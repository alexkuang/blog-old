<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-RLfRc4f/0/L/DSC_3412-L.jpg"></p>

<p>I have the fortune of living near a couple of markets that stock Rustichella, and this morning I spotted
some in a shape that I hadn&rsquo;t seen before and kinda had to go for it.  Nickel to anyone who guesses why it&rsquo;s called
&ldquo;torchio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was in the middle of drumming up a post about what I ended up making with it but got kind of caught up in a side-rant
that I realized I hadn&rsquo;t written about before and probably deserved its own post, so&hellip;  Here it is.</p>

<h3>All Dried Pasta</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a fair amount of people say (especially on shared grocery trips with college-level budgets) that &ldquo;pasta is
just pasta&rdquo; so the preferable choice is the cheapest one.  I don&rsquo;t disagree with the principle of making sure you get
appropriate value for your money, but I do disagree with that assessment of pasta&ndash;even the dried stuff.</p>

<p>There are significant (if subtle) differences in the quality of product between different tiers of manufacturers, and it
mostly boils down to two things: process, and ingredients.</p>

<h3>Rustichella</h3>

<p>At the top of my personal tier list is Rustichella Best Pasta&trade;.  They are the best dried pasta I&rsquo;ve tried thus far,
albeit with a price tag to match&ndash;The torchio above cost me about $6 for the package.  This is the pasta I look for when
I&rsquo;m going all-out with home-making-the-hell-out-of-everything.  I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to bother to do a crazy
sauce/etc from scratch, why start skimping on the pasta?</p>

<p>For ingredients, there are only two: durum flour, and water.  Simple, easy.</p>

<p>The process is where it gets a bit more interesting.  A lot of shapes like spaghetti, linguine, and penne are made by
extruding the pasta dough through a set of dies&ndash;basically a device with a hole in it.  Rustichella has their own
in-house bronze die system that works wonders on the end product and gives it a rough texture on the outside.  I don&rsquo;t
have a macro lens, but hopefully it can still be seen here:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-qRrC8cz/0/L/DSC_3451-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Even the smooth, non-ridged parts of the pasta have a nice roughness to it.  What this amounts to is a better ability for
the pasta to carry the sauce that it&rsquo;s mixed with, resulting in an overall better dish.</p>

<p>The other thing I think is worth noting is that Rustichella claims to use a low temperature slow dry, versus a more
typical high temperature quick dry.  My guess is that this yields better consistency in the product and possibly better
texture&ndash;In my experience, exposing dough to high temperatures does make it more prone to gumming up and even cracking.
I do feel like Rustichella has a slightly better mouth feel and cooks more evenly so the drying process could have
something to do with it, but this is purely anecdotal and could just be confirmation bias on my part.</p>

<h3>The Good Stuff</h3>

<p>Next on the list would be
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/De-Cecco-Bucatini-16-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B001EPPBE0/ref=pd_sim_gro_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=12NFHK20DVCYZAESJYFK">De Cecco</a>
and similar brands.  De Cecco is my &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; brand, and my go-to when I don&rsquo;t feel like pulling out all the stops or
when I can&rsquo;t find the shape of Rustichella I want.  And while Rustichella sits at the top of my list, De Cecco isn&rsquo;t too
far behind.  That is to say&hellip;  Rustichella might be leaps and bounds above price-wise and at times that&rsquo;s worth it, but
there isn&rsquo;t a correspondingly crazy gap in terms of the quality of the product.</p>

<p>As far as process, De Cecco still uses bronze dies so their pasta has a decent texture.  If you check out the amazon
link, the zoomed in photo of the boxes actually does a nice job showcasing that.</p>

<p>On ingredients, durum wheat is still at the top of the list (always a good sign!), but there seems to be a bunch of crap
tacked onto the end.  What&rsquo;s kind of funny is that in the amazon description, they say the product is a &ldquo;Good source of
Protein, Thiamin, Folic Acid, Iron, Riboflavin and Niacin&rdquo;, i.e. all of the extra ingredients at the end that aren&rsquo;t
flour.  Not sure if it&rsquo;s a nutrition play for marketing or what, but I wish they&rsquo;d just leave the pasta well enough
alone.</p>

<h3>The Lower Tier</h3>

<p>And trailing the bottom is the likes of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barilla-Pasta-Penne-16-Ounce/dp/B00IB1D764/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8">Barilla</a>,
<a href="http://www.shopwell.com/prince-penne-rigate/pasta/p/4112902036">Prince</a>,
and various grocery store brands.  This is where you start seeing shortcuts everywhere, and these are the ones I would
avoid except under duress.</p>

<p>For ingredients, you see the same deal along the lines of &ldquo;wheat with stuff added in.&rdquo;  However, what&rsquo;s noteworthy here
is that there are now two entries for the wheat in the ingredient list, generally listed as &ldquo;Semolina (Wheat), Durum
(Wheat)&rdquo;.  The difference between various types of flour deserves another post (or five), but the tl;dr is that &ldquo;durum
wheat&rdquo; is generally more process-heavy than &ldquo;semolina wheat&rdquo;.  My theories for the mixing here would be 1) cost cutting,
or 2) using the semolina to offset some other shortcoming in the process, e.g. high temp fast-drying.</p>

<p>A really obvious difference here comes from the process.  Brands in this tier tend to cheap out on their process as
well, and the most noticeable part of that is the use of plastic dies instead of metal ones.  As a result, the pasta&rsquo;s
surface is ultra-smooth, which leads to vastly inferior sauceability.  Go ahead, feel up some spaghetti from both De
Cecco and Prince.  One will be nice and rough, and the other will be as smooth as a shaved baby&rsquo;s bottom&ndash;Not that I
advocate shaving babies or anything.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>At the end of the day, getting this involved about the quality of dried pasta seems kind of petty, but these little
things add up.  Of course, to be fair, the price difference between, say, De Cecco and Rustichella might not be
reflective of the quality difference.  It&rsquo;s another instance of the 80-20 rule&ndash;On some days I feel like it&rsquo;s worth it,
other days not so much.  But I&rsquo;d argue that everyone that cares about their food should at least spring for something
like De Cecco.  Unless you&rsquo;re cooking with Chef Boyardee and Hamburger Helper, of course.  Then I don&rsquo;t think what pasta
is being used really matters.</p>
