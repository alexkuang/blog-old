    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been sick as a dog for the last couple of days, so I guess this week I&rsquo;ll keep it light.  Since it&rsquo;s about 0
degrees F outside right now, what better time to mention ramen?</p>

<p>The above was made with pork belly, spinach, and pickled mushrooms.  I&rsquo;ll probably write everything up in more detail
when I&rsquo;m feeling more prolific, but I&rsquo;d like to take this chance to mention that a great use for the leftover bones
(say, from a roast leg of lamb, or a chicken carcass) is ramen stock.  Just roast the bones in the oven and stick them
in a pot with a few aromatics and vegetables: onions, leeks, carrots, mushrooms, and so on.  Leave it to simmer for a
few hours, and boom.  Stock.  If it&rsquo;s not feasible to leave the stove on, a crock pot would probably work just as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Leg-of-Lamb/i-q4M6vbN/0/L/DSC_2277-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Leg-of-Lamb/i-q4M6vbN/0/L/DSC_2277-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Last weekend I saw a giant leg of New Zealand lamb that looked way too good to pass up, crazy Whole Foods prices or not.
Huge roasted joints of meat are always a win with me but I strongly prefer bone in; there&rsquo;s just so much more flavor
that way.  I took the basic steps from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvEdCmD8Pk">this video</a> by Thomas Keller, using
an oven temp of 325 for ~1hr and frenching the tip of the bone to aid in carving.  I finished the last few minutes with
a cranked up broiler to really get a nice crust on the surface.</p>

<p>There was one problem I had with the conventional wisdom, though: laying the herbs on/around the meat and just seasoning
the surface doesn&rsquo;t seem like it would be enough to really get that taste in there, especially with something this
thick.  So I took a cue from how cloves are used in ham, substituting the cloves for garlic and the ham joint for a lamb
leg.  Spearing the garlic with small sprigs of rosemary added just the right extra punch, and ended up staining the
garlic green as a bonus.</p>

<p>I would consider this experiment a success.  Embedding the garlic really gets the flavor into the meat, and the rosemary
adds a lot to the presentation as well. If nothing else, it can be an excuse to crack some Monty Python shrubbery jokes
at the dinner table.  Chances to do that don&rsquo;t come around nearly as often as they should.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to test out how images worked with the blog, but had nothing imminent to write about.  Since kittens are
already taken, here&rsquo;s a picture of a big bowl of beef with kimchi and rice.</p>

<p>Not too bad.</p>
