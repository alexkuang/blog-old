    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-hJtKLk9/0/L/DSC_3437-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-hJtKLk9/0/L/DSC_3437-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>As mentioned <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2015/03/28/side-rant-pasta/">previously</a>, this dish came primarily out of
spotting a new shape of pasta at a local market.  The idea is heavily inspired by risotto: Instead of doing the
conventional song and dance of boiling the pasta separately and recombining, everything is just done in one place.  It&rsquo;s
a bit less effort (I mean, who likes straining pasta? Communists, that&rsquo;s who) and the result turned out really nice.
The absorbs all the flavor from the ingredients vs just salted water, and the sauce gets all thick and velvety due to
getting the full brunt of the starch from the pasta.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-BwgT8Qc/0/L/DSC_3415-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-BwgT8Qc/0/L/DSC_3415-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>The ingredients are simple enough for one portion:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 link spicy italian sausage, de-skinned</li>
<li>&frac12; chopped onion</li>
<li>1 cup+ chicken broth</li>
<li>1 handful pasta</li>
<li>arugula</li>
</ul>


<p>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;1 handful&rdquo;?  Well, whatever you would consider one portion.  If I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say somewhere around &frac34;
cup.  But I generally don&rsquo;t like getting all anal about measuring savory foods.  That&rsquo;s reserved for baking and pastry,
which actually demand the precision.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h4>Brown the onion and meat</h4>

<p>First, take a pot with some oil over medium-high heat and chuck the onions in.  Let them fry around a little bit, then
add the sausage.  Keep cooking until nicely browned.  As a note, do try to avoid doing this in a nonstick pot/pan.  We
want the delicious fond (AKA burnt crunchy bits) at the bottom, since that will add more flavor to the sauce.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-kLsvwXG/0/L/DSC_3426-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-kLsvwXG/0/L/DSC_3426-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<h4>Add stock and pasta</h4>

<p>Pretty self-explanatory.  Add the stock with the pasta, and give everything a good stir.  Much like a risotto, you want
to pay attention to the pasta and keep stirring to prevent sticking.  This also has the nice benefit of integrating the
bits of deliciousness from the browning process.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-76G4qKQ/0/L/DSC_3428-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-76G4qKQ/0/L/DSC_3428-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>The cooking time will vary depending on the pasta, but generally following the package guidelines is a good idea.  For
the torchio, that was about 10 min and change.  The goal here is to cook everything through and reduce the stock to a
sauce-like consistency.  I find it helps to kind of keep things at light boil for most of the way to prevent
over-reducing, then just crank up the heat at the last few minutes as appropriate.</p>

<p>Also notice I haven&rsquo;t said anything about seasoning with salt.  This is because the stock will get stronger as it
reduces, so between that and the sausage meat there is probably enough salt in the dish already.  If anything, it might
be better to err on the side of caution and either cut the amount of stock with a bit of water or use low-sodium (if
you&rsquo;re buyin pre-packaged) and just add the salt back if necessary.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-7K5ZCRw/0/L/DSC_3433-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Torchio-w-Sausage/i-7K5ZCRw/0/L/DSC_3433-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>About a minute from done.  Check that starch.</p>

<h4>Turn off flame, fold in arugula</h4>

<p>Honestly, the pasta would probably be fine as-is, but it could definitely use some color and a vegetable element.
I used arugula, but some baby spinach or sauteed asparagus would also work.  For something like arugula, use more
than you think you need.  It wilts down in no time.</p>

<h4>Cheese and plate</h4>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/08/02/curry-house-noodles/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-02T13:49:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/08/02/curry-house-noodles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-House-Noodles/i-8tzWS42/0/L/DSC_3216-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-House-Noodles/i-8tzWS42/0/L/DSC_3216-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>These noodles were heavily inspired by my trip to <a href="http://www.thehse.com/">The House</a> in San Francisco.  They had a dish
that was essentially a very fancy lo mein, with some Satay-ish sauce with wasabi, topped with vegetable and steak.
Noodles?  Steak?  SAUCE?!  I didn&rsquo;t know it was possible to combine so many of my favorite things.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This version is much more simple, with much less vegetable variety and substituting the wasabi-sauce with the good ol&#8217;
standby Madras curry.</p>

<p>First, prep all relevant vegetables&ndash;In my case, julienning carrots and cucumbers, and slicing some onions.  Then boil
the noodles according to the relevant package instructions and shock with cold water to stop the cooking.  I recommend a
wheat-based noodle; nothing with huge amounts of egg, or alkaline.  Not that it&rsquo;d be terrible or anything, I just don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;d work as well.</p>

<p>While doing all that, also sear off and cook a steak&ndash;The specifics of a well-cooked steak probably deserve a post of
their own.</p>

<p>While the steak is resting in a nice warm place, get a pan nice and hot and cook off the onions and vegetables.  Add in
the spices.  I was feeling slightly lazy, so I went back to the ol&#8217; Madras curry powder.  Anyone hand-mixing spices
should go for something with heavier turmeric/coriander and just a touch of spice, as opposed to a mixture that&rsquo;s
basically all cayenne.</p>

<p>Add a tiny bit of water to turn the curry into a thick paste and help the vegetables cook off.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-House-Noodles/i-JBZW4kW/0/L/DSC_3210-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-House-Noodles/i-JBZW4kW/0/L/DSC_3210-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Add the noodles and give them a toss.  Add some cream to round out the flavors, then finish the cooking.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-House-Noodles/i-bdKbzWN/0/L/DSC_3215-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-House-Noodles/i-bdKbzWN/0/L/DSC_3215-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>And after everything is all nice, cooked, and combined, top with julienned cucumbers, steak, and maybe some scallions.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/07/11/murica-ribs/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-11T21:32:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/07/11/murica-ribs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-NJP5Mrc/0/L/DSC_3131-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-NJP5Mrc/0/L/DSC_3131-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>It is one of my greatest regrets as a Super Manly-Man that my current living situation is prohibitive against the
construction of fire pits, or even the ownership of so much as a grill.  And it is a travesty that on the Fourth of
July&ndash;one of the meatiest holidays of the meatiest of countries (&lsquo;MURICAAAAA)&ndash;I had to settle for a measly oven for my
ribs.  But alas, one must make do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As far as ribs done in a scrawny house-oven go, these were actually pretty good; I basically stole the entire thing
wholesale from an episode of Good Eats.  While I wouldn&rsquo;t say braised ribs inspire me to go out and slay bears, I&rsquo;d say
all in all it could have turned out a lot worse.</p>

<h2>Meat</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 racks of ribs</li>
</ul>


<h2>Spice Rub</h2>

<ul>
<li>8 parts (I used a &frac14; cup per &ldquo;part&rdquo;) brown sugar</li>
<li>3 parts kosher salt (halve that if you insist on using table salt, you heathen)</li>
<li>1 part Chili P</li>
<li>1 part &ldquo;everything else&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<p>A great big mix of&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Old Bay</li>
<li>Dried Thyme</li>
<li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
<li>Black Pepper</li>
<li>Onion Powder</li>
</ul>


<h2>Braising Liquid</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 cup white while</li>
<li>2 Tb white wine vinegar</li>
<li>A few cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
<li>drizzle of honey</li>
</ul>


<p>Combine everything in the Spice Rub and make sure to mix well.  I ended up mixing and storing it in a few Ball jars,
since this stuff will keep forever.  Cover the ribs in it.  Seriously, don&rsquo;t be shy with the spice either&ndash;what are you,
a communist?</p>

<p>After the ribs are completely coated, wrap them in aluminum foil.  First seal up the foil lengthwise, then roll up the
ends to make a neat little package.  If you&rsquo;re paranoid like me, you can double-layer the foil.  Stick this in the
fridge overnight.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-J847KwB/0/L/DSC_3069-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-J847KwB/0/L/DSC_3069-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-4MR872V/0/L/DSC_3074-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-4MR872V/0/L/DSC_3074-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Several beers and a good night&rsquo;s sleep later, wake up and groggily pre-heat your oven to 225F.  Put everything for the
Braising Liquid into a saucepan, and bring to a simmer.  Remove the ribs, unroll one of the foil ends, and dump the
braising liquid into the foil packages.  It&rsquo;s kind of like feeding a pet, if your pet were aluminum and you were
planning on eating its insides.</p>

<p>Place everything onto a metal tray, and the tray into the oven.  Wait for 2 &frac12; to 3 hours, then remove and unwrap the
ribs.  Drain the braising liquid into a saucepan.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-N6TLMVp/0/L/DSC_3079-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-N6TLMVp/0/L/DSC_3079-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Reduce the liquid in the pan until it reaches a sauce-like consistency.  We&rsquo;re talking about well past the french
&ldquo;spoon-back-coating&rdquo; level; look for something closer to a thick glaze.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-ZVPCzzC/0/L/DSC_3086-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-ZVPCzzC/0/L/DSC_3086-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Slather the sauce onto the ribs, then stick them under a broiler for a few minutes.  Marvel at the excellent color and
sizzling goodness.</p>

<p>Slice, cover with more sauce, and garnish with copious amounts of Independence.  Potato salad might also work.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/caramelized-lemongrass-chicken/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-03T15:06:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/caramelized-lemongrass-chicken</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FBL6Qgb/0/L/DSC_3055-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FBL6Qgb/0/L/DSC_3055-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t make this as often as I should, since to be honest prepping lemongrass is kind of a pain even with a food
processor.  But when I do make the effort, it&rsquo;s totally worth it.  The refreshing flavors of lemongrass play really well
with the rich, strong flavors of caramel and chicken.  Plus, who doesn&rsquo;t like fish sauce?  Make sure to use the brand
with the crabs, though; otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>1 lb boneless chicken thighs</li>
<li>4 stalks of lemongrass</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
<li>2 Tbs sugar, 2 Tbs high heat oil</li>
<li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
<li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
<li>cilantro</li>
<li>scallions</li>
<li>whole chilies</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
</ul>


<p>Start off with prepping the lemongrass.  Cut the bottoms off the stalks as well as the tops, right where they start
turning dark green.  Bash them a few times with the back of your knife (or a brick, I guess), and slice into thin rings.
Then run your knife through the thin rings a few times to end up with a fine mince.  This is probably the most painful
and labor-intensive part of this entire dish, but it&rsquo;s important.  Bruising and chopping the lemongrass in this way
is essential to releasing the flavor, but at the same time nobody wants to pick big pieces of lemongrass out of their
teeth.  For the lazy/economical among us, I&rsquo;m sure a few pulses in the food processor would also work.  I&rsquo;ve also been
told you can buy pulverized lemongrass frozen, but&hellip;  Come on.  If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, you obviously have the
time to do some proper prep.</p>

<p>Cut the chicken thighs into small &frac12; to 1-inch cubes.  If the thighs came with skin, great; keep it, it helps with
flavor.  If not, that&rsquo;s alright too I suppose.  Personally, I just buy thighs with bone and skin on, and just debone
myself.  And as with most of these types of dishes, I&rsquo;m morally obligated to note that trying to substitute chicken
breast here is a capital offense.  Thighs just have so much more flavor.</p>

<p>Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and a few tablespoons of the chopped lemongrass, and set it aside for a few
minutes.  In the meantime, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it&rsquo;s shimmery and just about to
smoke.  Add the sugar, which should melt with some stirring after a minute or two.  Keep stirring, and wait for the
sugar syrup to turn brown and caramel-y.  At no point should the mixture smoke: If it does, the pan&rsquo;s gotten too hot,
and should be taken off the heat for a bit.</p>

<p>Stir in the rest of the chopped lemongrass, the onion, and the garlic, and fry for a few minutes.  Crank the heat all
the way up and throw in the chicken.  After a minute, throw in the chilies, and keep cooking until the chicken&rsquo;s done.
Take the pan off the heat, then add the fish sauce.  (Hint: Make sure to save the fish sauce for when the high heat
cooking is done, or else it&rsquo;ll smell up the joint.)  Finish with chopped scallions and chopped cilantro.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FHVvjDS/0/L/DSC_3045-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FHVvjDS/0/L/DSC_3045-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>With a solid bowl of white rice, this amount of chicken is probably good for serving about 3-4 people, depending on
appetite needs and size.  For this particular run, I ended up with a bowl of vermicelli, with julienned cucumbers and
mint on the side.  Topped with more fish sauce.  Having no exposure to any sort of Vietnamese home culture, I can&rsquo;t
really speak to this dish&rsquo;s authenticity or anything like that.  I mean, I&rsquo;m sure some Vietnamese food icon is rolling
in their grave over my use of fish sauce and vermicelli, but at least it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/garlic-soy-chicken-wings/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-17T20:15:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/garlic-soy-chicken-wings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Honey-Soy-Wings/i-ZfrmLNX/0/L/DSC_2936-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Honey-Soy-Wings/i-ZfrmLNX/0/L/DSC_2936-L.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be <em>that</em> Asian who posts a chicken wing recipe involving some combination of garlic, soy, and honey.
Next thing you know I&rsquo;ll be writing book reviews for the Joy Luck Club and acting in sketches about Tiger Moms.  Though
I suppose the latter would be pretty entertaining&hellip;</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first chicken wing recipe I&rsquo;ve posted <em>(note to self: still need to port those old entries over&hellip;)</em>, but
it is a pretty quick and easy one.  The only awkward part is that in situations like this, it&rsquo;s not worth the effort to
not make a ton, but then everything takes a while to eat&hellip;  But I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good problem to have.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>3 lb chicken wings</li>
<li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>&frac14; cup honey</li>
<li>&frac14; cup soy sauce</li>
<li>&frac14; cup Shaoxing wine</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>


<p>To prepare, mix all the sauce ingredients together, and toss the chicken in.  If you&rsquo;re feeling really bored, jab them a
few times to help the sauce seep in.  Mix evenly, then let it sit in the fridge overnight.  In my experience, the wings
can be kept this way for up to 3 days&ndash;I&rsquo;d vouch for longer, but they&rsquo;re generally eaten in that time frame.</p>

<p>When ready, pre-heat the oven to 375, and bake for about 30 minutes.  Do note that I usually cook in batches, so if the
whole 3 lb needs to be done at once, 45 minutes would probably be safer.  Give them a quick toss on the stove with some
fresh herbs.  Scallions are usually a pretty good bet, but I like cilantro too.</p>
