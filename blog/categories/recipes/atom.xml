    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-NJP5Mrc/0/L/DSC_3131-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-NJP5Mrc/0/L/DSC_3131-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>It is one of my greatest regrets as a Super Manly-Man that my current living situation is prohibitive against the
construction of fire pits, or even the ownership of so much as a grill.  And it is a travesty that on the Fourth of
July&mdash;one of the meatiest holidays of the meatiest of countries (&lsquo;MURICAAAAA)&mdash;I had to settle for a measly oven for my
ribs.  But alas, one must make do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As far as ribs done in a scrawny house-oven go, these were actually pretty good; I basically stole the entire thing
wholesale from an episode of Good Eats.  While I wouldn&rsquo;t say braised ribs inspire me to go out and slay bears, I&rsquo;d say
all in all it could have turned out a lot worse.</p>

<h2>Meat</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 racks of ribs</li>
</ul>


<h2>Spice Rub</h2>

<ul>
<li>8 parts (I used a &frac14; cup per &ldquo;part&rdquo;) brown sugar</li>
<li>3 parts kosher salt (halve that if you insist on using table salt, you heathen)</li>
<li>1 part Chili P</li>
<li>1 part &ldquo;everything else&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<p>A great big mix of&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Old Bay</li>
<li>Dried Thyme</li>
<li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
<li>Black Pepper</li>
<li>Onion Powder</li>
</ul>


<h2>Braising Liquid</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 cup white while</li>
<li>2 Tb white wine vinegar</li>
<li>A few cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
<li>drizzle of honey</li>
</ul>


<p>Combine everything in the Spice Rub and make sure to mix well.  I ended up mixing and storing it in a few Ball jars,
since this stuff will keep forever.  Cover the ribs in it.  Seriously, don&rsquo;t be shy with the spice either&mdash;what are you,
a communist?</p>

<p>After the ribs are completely coated, wrap them in aluminum foil.  First seal up the foil lengthwise, then roll up the
ends to make a neat little package.  If you&rsquo;re paranoid like me, you can double-layer the foil.  Stick this in the
fridge overnight.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-J847KwB/0/L/DSC_3069-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-J847KwB/0/L/DSC_3069-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-4MR872V/0/L/DSC_3074-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-4MR872V/0/L/DSC_3074-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Several beers and a good night&rsquo;s sleep later, wake up and groggily pre-heat your oven to 225F.  Put everything for the
Braising Liquid into a saucepan, and bring to a simmer.  Remove the ribs, unroll one of the foil ends, and dump the
braising liquid into the foil packages.  It&rsquo;s kind of like feeding a pet, if your pet were aluminum and you were
planning on eating its insides.</p>

<p>Place everything onto a metal tray, and the tray into the oven.  Wait for 2 &frac12; to 3 hours, then remove and unwrap the
ribs.  Drain the braising liquid into a saucepan.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-N6TLMVp/0/L/DSC_3079-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-N6TLMVp/0/L/DSC_3079-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Reduce the liquid in the pan until it reaches a sauce-like consistency.  We&rsquo;re talking about well past the french
&ldquo;spoon-back-coating&rdquo; level; look for something closer to a thick glaze.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-ZVPCzzC/0/L/DSC_3086-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Murica-Ribs/i-ZVPCzzC/0/L/DSC_3086-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Slather the sauce onto the ribs, then stick them under a broiler for a few minutes.  Marvel at the excellent color and
sizzling goodness.</p>

<p>Slice, cover with more sauce, and garnish with copious amounts of Independence.  Potato salad might also work.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/caramelized-lemongrass-chicken/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-03T15:06:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/caramelized-lemongrass-chicken</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FBL6Qgb/0/L/DSC_3055-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FBL6Qgb/0/L/DSC_3055-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t make this as often as I should, since to be honest prepping lemongrass is kind of a pain even with a food
processor.  But when I do make the effort, it&rsquo;s totally worth it.  The refreshing flavors of lemongrass play really well
with the rich, strong flavors of caramel and chicken.  Plus, who doesn&rsquo;t like fish sauce?  Make sure to use the brand
with the crabs, though; otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>1 lb boneless chicken thighs</li>
<li>4 stalks of lemongrass</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
<li>2 Tbs sugar, 2 Tbs high heat oil</li>
<li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
<li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
<li>cilantro</li>
<li>scallions</li>
<li>whole chilies</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
</ul>


<p>Start off with prepping the lemongrass.  Cut the bottoms off the stalks as well as the tops, right where they start
turning dark green.  Bash them a few times with the back of your knife (or a brick, I guess), and slice into thin rings.
Then run your knife through the thin rings a few times to end up with a fine mince.  This is probably the most painful
and labor-intensive part of this entire dish, but it&rsquo;s important.  Bruising and chopping the lemongrass in this way
is essential to releasing the flavor, but at the same time nobody wants to pick big pieces of lemongrass out of their
teeth.  For the lazy/economical among us, I&rsquo;m sure a few pulses in the food processor would also work.  I&rsquo;ve also been
told you can buy pulverized lemongrass frozen, but&hellip;  Come on.  If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, you obviously have the
time to do some proper prep.</p>

<p>Cut the chicken thighs into small &frac12; to 1-inch cubes.  If the thighs came with skin, great; keep it, it helps with
flavor.  If not, that&rsquo;s alright too I suppose.  Personally, I just buy thighs with bone and skin on, and just debone
myself.  And as with most of these types of dishes, I&rsquo;m morally obligated to note that trying to substitute chicken
breast here is a capital offense.  Thighs just have so much more flavor.</p>

<p>Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and a few tablespoons of the chopped lemongrass, and set it aside for a few
minutes.  In the meantime, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it&rsquo;s shimmery and just about to
smoke.  Add the sugar, which should melt with some stirring after a minute or two.  Keep stirring, and wait for the
sugar syrup to turn brown and caramel-y.  At no point should the mixture smoke: If it does, the pan&rsquo;s gotten too hot,
and should be taken off the heat for a bit.</p>

<p>Stir in the rest of the chopped lemongrass, the onion, and the garlic, and fry for a few minutes.  Crank the heat all
the way up and throw in the chicken.  After a minute, throw in the chilies, and keep cooking until the chicken&rsquo;s done.
Take the pan off the heat, then add the fish sauce.  (Hint: Make sure to save the fish sauce for when the high heat
cooking is done, or else it&rsquo;ll smell up the joint.)  Finish with chopped scallions and chopped cilantro.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FHVvjDS/0/L/DSC_3045-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FHVvjDS/0/L/DSC_3045-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>With a solid bowl of white rice, this amount of chicken is probably good for serving about 3-4 people, depending on
appetite needs and size.  For this particular run, I ended up with a bowl of vermicelli, with julienned cucumbers and
mint on the side.  Topped with more fish sauce.  Having no exposure to any sort of Vietnamese home culture, I can&rsquo;t
really speak to this dish&rsquo;s authenticity or anything like that.  I mean, I&rsquo;m sure some Vietnamese food icon is rolling
in their grave over my use of fish sauce and vermicelli, but at least it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/garlic-soy-chicken-wings/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-17T20:15:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/garlic-soy-chicken-wings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Honey-Soy-Wings/i-ZfrmLNX/0/L/DSC_2936-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Honey-Soy-Wings/i-ZfrmLNX/0/L/DSC_2936-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be <em>that</em> Asian who posts a chicken wing recipe involving some combination of garlic, soy, and honey.
Next thing you know I&rsquo;ll be writing book reviews for the Joy Luck Club and acting in sketches about Tiger Moms.  Though
I suppose the latter would be pretty entertaining&hellip;</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first chicken wing recipe I&rsquo;ve posted <em>(note to self: still need to port those old entries over&hellip;)</em>, but
it is a pretty quick and easy one.  The only awkward part is that in situations like this, it&rsquo;s not worth the effort to
not make a ton, but then everything takes a while to eat&hellip;  But I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good problem to have.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>3 lb chicken wings</li>
<li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>&frac14; cup honey</li>
<li>&frac14; cup soy sauce</li>
<li>&frac14; cup Shaoxing wine</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>


<p>To prepare, mix all the sauce ingredients together, and toss the chicken in.  If you&rsquo;re feeling really bored, jab them a
few times to help the sauce seep in.  Mix evenly, then let it sit in the fridge overnight.  In my experience, the wings
can be kept this way for up to 3 days&mdash;I&rsquo;d vouch for longer, but they&rsquo;re generally eaten in that time frame.</p>

<p>When ready, pre-heat the oven to 375, and bake for about 30 minutes.  Do note that I usually cook in batches, so if the
whole 3 lb needs to be done at once, 45 minutes would probably be safer.  Give them a quick toss on the stove with some
fresh herbs.  Scallions are usually a pretty good bet, but I like cilantro too.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/12/shepherds-pie-week-10-australian/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-12T22:37:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/12/shepherds-pie-week-10-australian</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Shepherds-Pie/i-hnc6sSv/0/L/DSC_2915-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Shepherds-Pie/i-hnc6sSv/0/L/DSC_2915-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Alright, so I cheated a little bit.  Despite extensive (not really) research, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything in the top google
results for Australian that really clicked.  At least, anything using conventional ingredients; I didn&rsquo;t quite get the
chance to special-order some kangaroo.  Since I&rsquo;m told meat pies are popular in Australia and the lamb was technically
from there, it still counts&hellip;  Right?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Even though it&rsquo;s technically an Aussie theme, I went with a more british twist on the ingredients, especially with the
Worcestershire sauce.  The following makes enough to modestly feed 4 off a pretty decent size tray.  <em>No, I don&rsquo;t have
exact dimensions for the tray, it&rsquo;s a meat pie, eyeball it FFS.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>1 lb ground lamb</li>
<li>1 lb yellow potato, heavy cream</li>
<li>Stock, preferably beef</li>
<li>A dash (or 3) Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
<li>Carrots &lsquo;n peas (or other vegetables)</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Thyme</li>
</ul>


<p>First off, the meez.  Chop up the garlic, pick the thyme leaves, and finely dice the vegetables, if applicable.  In my
case, it&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;take the bag out of the freezer.&rdquo;  Seriously, for carrots and peas in something like meat pie,
frozen works best.</p>

<p>Put a nice heavy pan on the stove and get it ripping hot.  Add the lamb and garlic, and let the meat get some color.
Don&rsquo;t jab at it or anything for the first few minutes; we want it to fry, not boil.</p>

<p>After it gets a nice dark brown color, start stirring and breaking it apart into tiny pieces.  When it&rsquo;s done, you
should hear sizzling from fat, not hissing from steam&mdash;this should take 10, 15 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Stir in the worcestershire sauce and tomato paste, then add the thyme and beef stock.  How much beef stock is pretty
subjective: I use just enough to mix with the tomato paste for a gravy-ish texture.  The key is not so little that
everything is dry, but not so much that it bubbles over in the oven.  If I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s just shy of 2
cups, but perhaps a picture of the end product would be helpful?</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Shepherds-Pie/i-kZsbxX3/0/L/DSC_2895-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Shepherds-Pie/i-kZsbxX3/0/L/DSC_2895-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Put a lid on, and let it simmer on very low heat for at least 30-40 minutes, preferably an hour, just to let everything
come together.  Alternately, popping the pan in the oven at ~300-350 also works.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 400.  While the meat is going and the oven is warming, prepare the mash.  I really hope I don&rsquo;t have
to provide detailed instructions for that&hellip;  If that&rsquo;s needed, there&rsquo;s always google.</p>

<p>When the meat is done, stick it in a tray and spread the mash on top.  Score with a fork for effect, if desired.  Then
stick into the oven again for about 30 minutes to finish everything off and brown the top a bit.  For presentation, I
bet some eggwash would help with the browning, but I&rsquo;ve never found it necessary.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Shepherds-Pie/i-qMkv5Mz/0/L/DSC_2908-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Shepherds-Pie/i-qMkv5Mz/0/L/DSC_2908-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>In this particular attempt, I added a bit too much stock and it ended up bubbling out onto the potato.  Still delicious,
though.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Curry Chicken Galantine]]></title>
    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/03/30/curry-chicken-galantine/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-30T21:30:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/03/30/curry-chicken-galantine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-Chicken-Galantine/i-K79mZTH/0/L/DSC_2867-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-Chicken-Galantine/i-K79mZTH/0/L/DSC_2867-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p><em>What?!  A food post that isn&rsquo;t themed?!</em>  That&rsquo;s right.  While the 52weeks deal resulted in consistency, doing only
those posts all the time got a bit stale, so I decided to go a bit off the beaten path.  This dish was inspired by what
is still one of the coolest videos I&rsquo;ve ever seen: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAekQ5fzfGM">Jacques Pepin deboning an entire chicken</a>.
A Galantine is a French (big surprise) technique where all of the bones are removed from a chicken, but the meat and
skin is kept intact like the remains of some sort of creepy skinwalker type transformation.   Everything is then
stuffed, rolled up, and roasted.</p>

<p>Despite its simplicity, it&rsquo;s one of the coolest techniques I have ever seen, and it makes carving much much easier
since you don&rsquo;t have any bones to contend with while grappling a hot chicken fresh out of the oven.  I&rsquo;ve only done this
a few times, and it&rsquo;s already become my de-facto method for preparing whole chicken&mdash;the cool factor, the corpse
desecration, the ease of plating&hellip;  What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Why Curry</h3>

<p>For this particular chicken, I decided to combine a thoroughly French technique with thoroughly un-French
flavors&mdash;Curry.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;m all elitist and tend mix my own spices nowadays, my childhood was spent eating curries made with instant
powder mixes.  (<em>For the record, nothing wrong with curry powder mixes, assuming they&rsquo;re made from actual spices&hellip;</em>)
The most common of these was Madras Curry, particularly <a href="http://vietwah.com/Joomla/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/fab54182fc7c87449f726b0e7cb3bec9.jpg">this brand</a>.
If the image link breaks, just google &ldquo;Ca Ri An Do&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s a pretty unremarkable curry based heavily in turmeric,
definitely tending more towards the mild flavors that the Chinese/Japanese tend to flavor rather than the ripping hot
Vindaloo style you can see with some of the Indian curries.</p>

<p>But one of the problems I&rsquo;ve always had with this one in particular was that the sauce would have to get really thick
for the flavor to come out in the chicken.  In this past I&rsquo;d done this with judicious (read: heavy-handed) use of cream,
starch from potatoes, and reduction of liquid, but it never really got to the level I would have liked.  So when I was
thinking about variations on a Galantine, doing a stuffing with this curry powder was just about the first thing that
came to mind.</p>

<h3>The Chicken</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t possibly explain the technique behind a Galantine as well as the man himself, so if you didn&rsquo;t click on the
video link above, I suggest you do.  Go on.  I&rsquo;ll even put it down here as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAekQ5fzfGM">Link</a></p>

<p>Watched it?  Good.  Pretty awesome, isn&rsquo;t it?  The stuffing is pretty simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finely dice yukon potatoes and carrots, and boil until tender</li>
<li>Mash up with a fork, dumping in generous helpings of curry powder and a pinch of salt</li>
<li>Add a touch of heavy cream for consistency, and because cream is delicious.</li>
</ol>


<p>In essence it was a rustic mashed potato.  I&rsquo;m sure a super fancy restaurant could do a potato and carrot puree or
something, but ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that in this kitchen.  Stuff the chicken, truss it up, dust it with more curry
powder and salt, and stick it in the oven.  I stole my roasting technique from Thomas Keller&mdash;450 for ~25 minutes, then
370 until the internal temp of the thickest part of the thigh is 160&mdash;but really, whatever works.  Afterwards I just
made a sauce by deglazing the stuff in the roasting pan with some cream, and&mdash;<em>voila!</em></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-Chicken-Galantine/i-46XNmjz/0/L/DSC_2864-L.jpg">http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Curry-Chicken-Galantine/i-46XNmjz/0/L/DSC_2864-L.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Some people might say this technique is a bit old fashioned, but screw them.  Clearly they&rsquo;ve never deboned a chicken
with their hands&mdash;It&rsquo;s like ripping off a scab, except a million times more satisfying.  And delicious.  And chicken
wing lollipops?  Come on.  Ridiculous.</p>
