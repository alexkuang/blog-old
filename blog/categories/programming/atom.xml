    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, one of our tech leads at work previewed <a href="https://github.com/ogrodnek/analog-metrics-talk">a talk</a> that he&rsquo;s
planning to give on analog metrics for the upcoming Strange Loop conference.  I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play with
microcontrollers, and this really gave me a kick in the pants to get started.  Since I had a bit of amazon credit lying
around, I decided to buy an arduino starter kit with all sorts of buttons, lights, and doo-dads, but not enough power to
actually fry anything (I hope).  I still can&rsquo;t tell my head from my ass, but so far I can make a button turn on an LED.</p>

    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2014/04/26/hack-days-are-awesome</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, we had a &ldquo;hack day&rdquo; at work.  Or more precisely, two hack days.  I think the name is pretty
self-explanatory&mdash;work on whatever you want, which can be something helpful to or completely unrelated to your currently
assigned tasks, as long as it&rsquo;s something interesting.  Now, &ldquo;hack time&rdquo; is a pretty established institution in the
software world, especially amongst the hip startuppy companies.  I&rsquo;m sure everyone has heard of Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; idea
by now, and the story of Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox starting as a side-project.  Proponents (especially those who are trying to
pitch a business case to managers with varying degrees of pointy-haired-ness) cite building camaraderie, stimulating
creativity, and increasing morale as some of the biggest benefits.</p>

<p>None of this is news.  But I came away this week with a surprising realization.  When coding professionally for business
use cases, things like resilience and stability are often at the top of the requirement list&mdash;Or at least, I&rsquo;d really
hope so.  If it&rsquo;s not, kindly give me the name of your company so I know what stock to not buy ;).  To this end, coding
is never as simple as just sitting down and banging away at a keyboard.  It involves testing, discussions, design,
thinking, more testing, more thinking, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  These are all very, very good things.  But I, at least, was surprised at how nice it was to just
sit down and bang away at a keyboard with abandon.  It sounds rather obvious in hindsight, but compared to the usual
rigorously managed process of software development at work, it&rsquo;s super liberating to just cowboy out some code with no
considerations other than speed and getting the job done.  And what&rsquo;s more, I realized that I had constrained myself to
the same careful management in all of my personal projects as well, especially when prototyping out potential MVPs and
such.  Again&mdash;Definitely a good thing, in most cases.  But after this week I&rsquo;m thinking that injecting some &ldquo;hack
day&rdquo;-ish time into my personal projects is in order, if for no reason other than to let the crazy out.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> &ndash; Hack days are awesome.  I should do more of them.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2013/12/23/cmd-misadventures-codebase-size/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-23T06:50:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2013/12/23/cmd-misadventures-codebase-size</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After watching the <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">wat</a> talk and trolling my friends with the
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world">aneditor</a> talk for about the 200th time, I decided to
finally purchase one season of the Destroy All Software screencasts, despite the (IMHO) steep price tag and my financial
destitution.  (So far?  Totally worth it.  But a full review of the screencasts is neither here nor there.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of the unix power tools&mdash;<code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>xargs</code>, and so forth&mdash;but the DAS talks introduced
an idea that had never occurred to me for some insane reason: combine them with git to extract some interesting
information about your codebase.  And so, I decided to go diving into my biggest scala project for insights about its
code size.</p>

<p>One of the most common problems that code size can indicate is the presence of &ldquo;god classes&rdquo; or libraries, which know
and do way too much and thus are correspondingly bigger than the rest of the code by orders of magnitude.  This command
was relatively simple and does not involve git, so here it is in its entirety:</p>

<p>```bash
alexkuang@Orion [00:00:00] [~foobar/src/main/scala] [master]
&ndash;> % find . -type f -name &ldquo;*.scala&rdquo; | while read file; do wc -l $file; done | sort -n</p>

<pre><code>   9 ./com/foobar/models/Permission.scala
  11 ./com/foobar/util/LocParams.scala
  14 ./com/foobar/util/OrgSettings.scala
  16 ./com/foobar/security/package.scala
  17 ./com/foobar/scripts/ReloadStageDB.scala
  18 ./com/foobar/scripts/oneoff/InitSchema.scala
  # ...
 231 ./com/foobar/js/Calendar.scala
 247 ./com/foobar/persistence/Access.scala
 287 ./com/foobar/snippet/BookingCalendar.scala
 307 ./com/foobar/lib/Registration.scala
 319 ./com/foobar/lib/Scheduler.scala
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The output was slightly interesting, but nothing groundbreaking.  300 lines is not ideal to me, but manageable.  Broken
down quickly, <code>find #...</code> finds all files inside the current directory ending in &lsquo;.scala&rsquo;, reads each file in, and
passes it off to wc -l, which does a linecount on the file, whitespace and all.  <code>sort</code> does what its name implies, with
<code>-n</code> making it sort <code>1 2 3 11</code> instead of <code>1 11 2 3</code>.  The information was slightly cool, but as a hack it&rsquo;s not very
interesting, so let&rsquo;s throw some git in there to try to get a sense of how fast the codebase has grown over time.  After
all, superlinear growth is usually indicative of a ton of repetition and therefore unnecessary code complexity.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, starting with walking the git repo.  <code>git rev-list &lt;branch&gt;</code> should do what we want it to, but in the case of
larger repos it the list can get a bit unwieldy/huge.  Enter <code>awk</code>, which lets you do a bunch of neat things with your
text but most importantly has an easy variable for line number, of all things <em>(note to self: learn2awk better?)</em>, thus:
<code>awk 'NR % &lt;n&gt; == 0'</code> to get only every nth revision list.  Combine that with the same reading as above, and do a
similar scala file find with a linecount, and the command is as follows: <em>(Yes, in this particular project I dev&rsquo;d right
in master instead of using a nvie-style git-flow.  Bad developer, bad!)</em></p>

<p><code>bash
git rev-list master | awk 'NR % 20 == 0' | while read revhash; do git checkout -q $revhash | \  
&amp;&amp; find . -name '*.scala' | xargs cat | wc -l; done
</code></p>

<p>The more finicky among us might comment right about now that the command is already pretty huge and nigh unreadable if
revisited in about two weeks&mdash;and he&rsquo;d be right.  But this is a quick one-off hack for some interesting info (something
that unix tools are absolutely amazing at), and if I cared that much I&rsquo;d probably write a real script, or at least
re-format it into a proper bash function.</p>

<p>So the above command gives us a bunch of line counts which is useful, but it doesn&rsquo;t really give us a sense of the
progression.  At this point I&rsquo;d usually either 1) compose some huge complicated thing that kept track of the current
line AND the previous in an attempt to do math, or 2) give up and write a real script for it later, but one of the DAS
videos showed something that was completely new to me: using <code>jot</code> to create a chart.  Even if I learned nothing else,
this alone made everything worth it.  Very quickly&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash
&ndash;> % jot &ndash; 1 5</p>

<h1>print range 1 to 5</h1>

<p>1
2
3
4
5
&ndash;> % jot -b &lsquo;*&rsquo; &ndash; 1 5</p>

<h1>range 1 to 5, printing &lsquo;*&rsquo; instead</h1>

<p>*
*
*
*
*
&ndash;> % jot -b &lsquo;*&rsquo; &ndash; 1 5 | xargs</p>

<h1>For all its magic, xargs just chunks up your input to be used as args.</h1>

<hr />

<p>&ndash;> % jot -b &lsquo;*&rsquo; &ndash; 1 5 | xargs | tr -d &lsquo; &rsquo;</p>

<h1>And tr to translate.  Side note: as a recovering Perl user, it slightly annoys me that there&rsquo;s a tr util but not an s</h1>

<h1>util.  But I guess that&rsquo;s what sed is for&hellip;?</h1>

<hr />

<p>```</p>

<p>And now all that&rsquo;s left is to combine the <code>jot</code> magic with the above command by reading a the linecount into a variable
called <code>lines</code>, using that in the <code>jot</code> call, and printing everything out.  In the interest of full disclosure, here&rsquo;s
the final command along with the output from my project:</p>

<p><code>``bash
-&gt; % git rev-list master | awk 'NR % 20 == 0' | while read revhash; do git checkout -q $revhash &amp;&amp; \  
find . -name '*.scala' | xargs cat | wc -l | \  
read lines &amp;&amp; ((hashes = $lines / 100)) &amp;&amp; \  
echo "</code>jot -b &lsquo;#&rsquo; &ndash; 1 $hashes | xargs | tr -d &lsquo; &rsquo;` $lines"; done</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The growth at the beginning looked pretty normal, and I must say I&rsquo;m slightly happy that around the middle it remained
constant, and even took a slight dip afterwards.  After the dip though it seems like the growth started shooting up
again, which is not a good sign.  This is consistent with my personal experience, as I recall starting to really throw
in the super-hacks at around that time, so everything is probably due for another refactor.</p>

<p>In closing, I&rsquo;d like to remark that while this post was pretty monolithic and it took a lot of text to explain
everything for the first time, in real life this command probably took about 2-3 minutes to write.  And that&rsquo;s what I
find these utils are really really good at&mdash;Quick dirty answers to the little &ldquo;I wonder&hellip;&rdquo; / &ldquo;What if&hellip;&rdquo; questions
that tend to pop up while coding.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Clojure First Impressions]]></title>
    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2013/12/20/clojure-first-impressions/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-20T14:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2013/12/20/clojure-first-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After achieving some measure of familiarity with Scala, and with newfound copious amounts of free time, I decided I
wanted to see more of what the functional world had to offer.  The obvious choices were Haskell and Clojure; but while
Haskell has the upper hand in functional purity and a crazy advanced type system, I like to think I&rsquo;m a pragmatic guy at
heart and Clojure seemed more practical.  I haven&rsquo;t worked with it too extensively, but my experience so far can be
summarized by two words: Simple and composable.</p>

<h4>The language</h4>

<p>Clojure is a refreshingly simple language.  Despite my last foray into a Lisp being about half a decade ago, the
learning curve was much gentler than I&rsquo;d expected.  Maybe it&rsquo;s because I was already in a functional programming
mindset, but the straightforward syntax and <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/">abundance</a>
<a href="http://clojure.org/getting_started">of</a> <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">documentation</a> probably helped.  And on a
completely subjective level: <code>iDislikeCamelCase</code>, and <code>clojure-case-is-pretty-neat</code>.</p>

<h4>The ecosystem</h4>

<p>Of course, the overall enjoyability of using a language doesn&rsquo;t depend solely on the core language, but also the
libraries and toolchain available.  Most of the libraries I&rsquo;ve seen keep in line with the design of the language: super
lightweight, super simple, super composable, and as a result super easy to ramp up on and use.  Theoretically that
should just describe all good library design in general, but I feel like the clojure community takes it especially to
heart.</p>

<p>Compojure, for example, chose to implement its url
<a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Destructuring-Syntax">destructuring</a> to closely follow the destructuring
available in stock Clojure <code>let</code>s expressions.  I can&rsquo;t help but draw the comparison to Scala, where I&rsquo;d be more likely
to find that url decomposition exists only in the form of an exotic DSL.  Another huge example for me is the difference
between the simplicity of the Clojure build tool Leiningen and the craziness of Scala&rsquo;s SBT.  Sorry SBT&mdash;You work very
well, but I&rsquo;d rather not have to google what the <code>&lt;++=</code> operator does every time I touch the build.</p>

<h4>With vim</h4>

<p>One of my original reasons for leaning clojure was its close integration with
<a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/lighttable/">LightTable</a>.  As it turns out, the functionality I liked could be
replicated in vim with <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace">fireplace.vim</a>&rsquo;s quasi-insta-repl and insta-doc, due in
no small part to leiningen and nrepl&rsquo;s awesomeness.
<a href="https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim">Rainbow parentheses</a> is also pretty cool, and has been useful enough
that I will probably keep it on even when I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the hardcore levels of parens in Lisps:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rainbow-parens.png"></p>

<h4>Overall</h4>

<p>If programming languages could be graded on usability, Clojure would get full marks.  It has been a breath of fresh air
after dealing with the crazy complexity in Scala.  Undoubtedly working through the latter had a part in making the
former much easier, and Scala will always have a place with me, but for now I find myself slowly joining the rest of the
Clojure bandwagon.</p>

    <link href="http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2013/12/11/zelda-as-a-metaphor-for-complexity/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-11T18:29:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://alexkuang.github.io/blog/2013/12/11/zelda-as-a-metaphor-for-complexity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, my gaming bandwidth has been taken up by the new Zelda game, A Link Between Worlds.  It&rsquo;s been a while since
my last trip to Hyrule, but I&rsquo;ve always loved the ingenuity behind the dungeons, especially the ones in Ocarina of Time
which could take upwards of hours (Water Temple, I&rsquo;m looking at you) to complete on the first run.  One of them jumps to
mind particularly: The Forest Temple, a dungeon you encounter in the early-mid game immediately after gaining access to
adult Link.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like a completely normal dungeon&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got your wolves, you&rsquo;ve got your carnivorous plants,
and the obvious puzzle in the form of 4 torches that have to be lit.  Fairly straightforward, until the game hits you
with this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/forest-temple-hallway.jpg"></p>

<p>The first time you hit the twisting hallway, you have to follow it as-is to the other side, your perspective being
warped, to end up in a room with you standing on its &ldquo;wall&rdquo;.  On the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; is a chest, inaccessible in your current
state, and further on is a door you don&rsquo;t have the key to.  After a few more rooms and a battle with some wolves, you
end up with the bow which allows you to hit a switch to un-twist the hallway, bringing a completely new
perspective to the rooms&mdash;Most obviously, the chest from the earlier &ldquo;floor&rdquo; is now reachable, and after a little
contemplation and a lot of climbing, you get the key to the previously locked door&hellip;  <em>Which you can&rsquo;t access until you
re-twist the hallway.</em></p>

<p>This simple sequence is, in essence, what makes the classical Zelda dungeons challenging and oh so much fun.  In
addition to an &ldquo;item of the moment&rdquo;, each area contains an inventive mechanic that completely changes the landscape
of the entire dungeon.  A room is completely different when your perspective is rotated, platforms become traversable
after you flood the floor with sand, and so on.  It&rsquo;s no longer just <em>Push a block over here</em>, it&rsquo;s <em>Push a block over
here to change the water level so we can push that other block, and then change the water level back to align the two
blocks properly and maybe we can finally get to that chest over there.  Oh wait, that didn&rsquo;t work, maybe if I switch the
water level back BEFORE moving the second block&hellip;</em></p>

<p>Sound familiar?  The hardest dungeons' mechanics tend to use some piece of outside state to introduce exponentially more
complex interactions between the existing items that Link already has access to.  Interactions that now depend not only
on the current environment, but also the configuration of surrounding environments, and probably the order that
everything was done as well.  Keeping track of all that is welcome, even enjoyable, when I&rsquo;m playing Zelda.  But I have
no wish to be dealing with such things when I&rsquo;m trying to make sure my code is doing what I want it to.</p>
