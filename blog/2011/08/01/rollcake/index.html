<blockquote><p>Rollcake is still one of my favorite things to eat, to this day.  This particular experiment proved to be especially
useful: from where I live now it&rsquo;s kind of a pain to get to any Hong Kong-style bakery with regularity&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-GZsDtFD/0/L/DSC_0847-L.jpg"></p>

<p>This cake originally came from attempts to recreate what you can find at basically any chinese bakery/teahouse.  I threw
around with many western recipes, but most of them tasted horrendous, and were far too dry&mdash;much like western spongecake
recipes that I&rsquo;ve found in general.  In addition, there were some fairly convoluted rolling methods (there was one where
you would roll it without the filling, put it in the fridge, take it out, unroll it, fill it, and then re-roll it and
put it in the fridge) that ended up not working 99% of the time anyway.  Eventually, I went to Hong Kong google to look
for leads, which also didn&rsquo;t turn up  much, and started playing around on my own.  Of course, when I perfected the alpha
model, I trashed the hard drive I had the recipe written down on, and had to recently reconstruct it on the fly.  The
result below is the closest I&rsquo;ve come so far.  Plus it works very well as a general spongecake.  (Note:  There are
decimals in the gram measurements because I formulated this against 10 eggs; however, 5 eggs is plenty enough for most
occasions, and you can just round down for the measurements.  This will make enough to fill an approximately 12&#8221;x9&#8221;x1&#8221;
jelly roll pan.)</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>5 large eggs</li>
<li>75g flour</li>
<li>2.5g baking powder</li>
<li>50g sunflower or other neutral oil</li>
<li>40g milk</li>
<li>10g lemon juice</li>
<li>lemon zest</li>
<li>2.5g salt</li>
<li>37.5g sugar</li>
<li>100g confectioner&rsquo;s sugar</li>
<li>cream</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pre-heat the oven at 355 degrees F.</li>
<li>Separate the egg whites and egg yolks.</li>
<li>Combine the yolks with the flour, oil, baking powder, salt, sugar, and whisk to combine.</li>
<li>Add the milk slowly, 1/3 at a time, whisking until smooth each time.  This is to ensure you end up with a smooth,
lumpless batter.</li>
<li>Whisk in the lemon juice.</li>
<li>Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks, adding the confectioner&rsquo;s sugar a little at a time.  I prefer &frac12; of the sugar
when the whites foam, and &frac12; when the whites have formed stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Put 1/3 of the whites from step 5 into the mixture from steps 2-4, and fold in to combine.  Fold the resulting
mixture back into the whites.</li>
<li>Bake in a parchment paper-lined tray for 13 minutes, then lower the temperature to 200 F and bake for 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Take the tray out of the oven and remove the cake with the parchment paper from the tray.  Leave it out to cool to
room temperature.</li>
<li>While it&rsquo;s cooling, whip some cream&mdash;about 100ml is more than enough for this size of cake.  Don&rsquo;t use any
sugar&mdash;the sugar from the cake will combine with the cream after the appropriate rest.  Also, say no to whipped
cream out of a can.  Every time you fill a cake with coolwhip, God hangs a kitten.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of cream across the cake, leaving a few inches at the end so that when you roll it the cake will
stay rolled.  Roll up the cake with the parchment paper.  I actually don&rsquo;t have the words for this part, especially
since I haven&rsquo;t got a method down for consistently turning out good rolls.  So here&rsquo;s an animated picture to show
you how I do it.  The only tip I can give is to use the parchment paper as a support system so that the cake doesn&rsquo;t
break up while rolling.  There ARE a few other small things I&rsquo;ve noted, but I&rsquo;m not going to post them till I can
consistently reproduce results.  Soz.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-BGWXqq5/0/O/roll.gif"></li>
<li>Put the cake into the fridge.  Let the cake rest for a few hours so that the flavors from the cake and the filling
have time to meld, and the cream has time to set.</li>
<li>Slice and serve.  This is a good tip for cake in general, but run the knife under hot water and wipe it off with a
paper towel to heat up the knife; it results in a cleaner cut.  Repeat every couple slices or so.  This is useful
for other cakes, but especially for this one, and very especially if you are impatient and try to eat before the
cream has time to set.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do not put the lemon juice and the milk together under any circumstances.  Do not put them in the same cup to add to
the batter together.  Do not add lemon juice when you have a pool of milk on top of the batter.  Just don&rsquo;t.  Why?
Here&rsquo;s why:
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-mwNN62P/0/M/DSC_0801-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Do not skip the cooling period.  If you don&rsquo;t let the cake cool before filling it, it will melt the cream, making it
slide around, and it&rsquo;ll make the job of cake-rolling even harder.</li>
<li>When combining the white mixture with the yolk mixture, be thorough.  The combination is kind of like a macaron
batter, but much less anal; you have a lot of leeway, but you still need to be fairly precise with it.  Here is a
series of informative photographs to illustrate. Since it&rsquo;s harder to see in a regular batter, for these pictures I
used a batter laced with cocoa powder.</li>
<li>Picture 1: If you bake at this stage, you&rsquo;re an idiot. Notice the extreme bumps. The batter still holds its shape
really well. And more importantly, there are still streaks of discrete whites in the batter.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-hSWBkcj/0/M/DSC_0796-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Picture 2: Close, but not quite. Notice that the batter still sort of refuses to flatten down, and there are subtle
small white streaks in the batter.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-D6krDGn/0/M/DSC_0797-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Picture 3: Just ready. The color is completely even, and the batter flows, but it is still very very airy. If you keep
going after this stage, you will overmix and knock air out of the cake.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-s7KqGFL/0/M/DSC_0798-M.jpg"></li>
<li>For variations, you may substitute the lemon juice for more milk; just keep the amount of liquid consistent at 50g per
batch of this size.  Likewise, you can probably ditch the zest if you need, it doesn&rsquo;t play too well with, say, mocha
flavors.  For example, for the cake I used in the pictures, I subbed out the 10g lemon juice for milk, and added 4g
cocoa powder instead of lemon zest.  On that note, try not to add too much weight to the batter (for example,
substituting all the sugar for cocoa), as it will cause the whites to collapse.  Also some ingredients may be more
absorbent than others, which may result in a dry cake.  Whatever the case, tread lightly; if possible, just color the
cake and play with the fillings.</li>
<li>For fillings, it&rsquo;s best to use things that are not sweet, as the sugar from the cake with fuse with the filling while
it rests in the fridge.  When I make chocolate or coffee filling, I never add sugar; likewise for the plain filling.
One of the reasons that western rollcakes are so godawful is because their sponges are far to sweet, and they fill it
with jam, which results in a giant mouthful of sugar of diabetic proportions.</li>
<li>The ones I find at asian bakeries tend to have a brownish skin around the outside.  I still have not yet figured out
how they do this; even when I achieve it, it peels off on contact, and is not sturdy at all.  It probably has
something to do with a nonstick baking spray they use or something.</li>
<li>A common one is also a sort of semi lemon curd filling, except more delicious.  I WILL figure it out one day, but I
have not yet.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Origami 101</h3>

<p>I was feeling bored, so here is a simple instructional as to how to most effectively line your jelly roll pan with
parchment paper.  This is actually more important than you may think, as it will influence the shape of the cake, and
therefore make your life easier or harder depending on how you do it.</p>

<p>First, fold in your parchment paper so that it confirms to the dimensions of your pan.  I will use a smaller piece just
for demonstrations.  Let&rsquo;s start with the first corner:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-ZJTzjnh/0/M/DSC_0802-M.jpg"></p>

<p>Bring the flaps up, then bring together the creases (see next step).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-L4kgJcz/0/M/DSC_0803-M.jpg"></p>

<p>It should look something like this:  Fold down the paper, and you
have one corner done.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-vpqPFrj/0/M/DSC_0804-M.jpg"></p>

<p>Repeat with the other four corners, and you now have a mini paper tray to put into the baking tray.   As a note, which
way the little flaps face does not matter, unless you&rsquo;re completely anally retentive.</p>
