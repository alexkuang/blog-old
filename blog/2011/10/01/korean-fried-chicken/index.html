<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Korean-Fried-Chicken/i-WVNV9G4/0/L/DSC_1146-L.jpg"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be frank.  The chicken I had at Bonchon has been haunting my dreams.  Since I went the first time, I&rsquo;ve had the
chicken once more via takeout, and wanted more an uncountable number of times.  And like all the other times that I&rsquo;ve
experienced such cravings, I set about recreating the food in question.</p>

<p>One google led to another, and I slowly learned more about Fried Chicken a la Kim Jong Il, and the many ways it was
different from your standard American fare, or even the chicken you can find at the local Chinese takeout.  The secret
to the texture of the chicken seems to be a thin batter combined with a double frying.  I found this interesting, since
all the deep-frying I&rsquo;ve tried so far has benefited from a second run in the oil&ndash;Chinese Pepper Squid comes to mind.
Furthermore, contrary to my instincts the chicken was not brined or seasoned at all being fried&ndash;the flavor came from a
sort of glaze that is applied to it right afterwards.  I suppose it does explain why the drumsticks at Bonchon tasted a
bit less intense than the wings.</p>

<p>Unlike in my naive youth, I knew not to trust any one site&rsquo;s information.  And so I aggregated knowledge from many
sources across the great network of tubes that is the internet, eventually ending up with something workable.  The first
trial was a success in terms of the chicken itself&ndash;I had recreated the crunchy texture of the outside along with the
perfect cookedness of the inside.  Unfortunately, this first trial&rsquo;s seasoning was completely off, with the rice vinegar
and garlic content bringing the flavor to epically acidic levels.  The next trial I decreased the garlic and got rid of
the rice vinegar, and it was much more acceptable, much closer to the garlic soy flavoring that I knew and loved.  After
some more characteristic tweaking, I arrived at my current results.  Before you start, I kindly ask you to read the
warning in the notes, even if you find my Notes section pedantic and boring.  It&rsquo;s for your own safety.  And now without
further ado&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chicken wings &amp; drumsticks.  Either will do; personally I prefer the wings slightly.  I suppose breasts or something
could work as well, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it&ndash;dark meat is always superior (yeah I did).  Make sure to get boned
parts with the skin on&ndash;The skin is essential for the perfect crisp, and meat with the bone on is ALWAYS more
flavorful.  For the purposes of this batch, assume about 6 wings and 2-3 drumsticks for a decent mix.</li>
<li>2/3 cups flour</li>
<li>1 heaping Tbsp corn starch</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic (or 2 large cloves)</li>
<li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
<li>&frac34; Tbsp sesame oil</li>
<li>Pinch of sugar</li>
<li>Lots of oil for deep-frying</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Prepare your glaze first so it has time to sit.  Mince the garlic very finely, then add the honey, soy sauce, and
sesame oil.  The sugar is optional, more of a taste thing than anything&ndash;I personally prefer it without.  You can
also stick the whole lot in a blender if you want the garlic to be pureed and integrated fully into the mixture.</li>
<li>If you are using wings, cut them into three sections&ndash;the wing drumette, the wing proper, and the tip.  Discard the
tip&ndash;you&rsquo;re not really going to eat it, and frying it isn&rsquo;t saving you anything, stop fooling yourself.</li>
<li>Prepare the batter.  Combine the flour and corn starch, then add as much water as it takes to get a liquid
consistency.  You want something approximating a crepe batter, or something a bit thinner than a pancake batter.  The
idea here is to get it as thin as possible while still having it reasonably adhere to the surface of the chicken.</li>
<li>Drop the chicken in the batter (remember, skin on), mix to coat evenly, and heat your oil to 350 degrees F.</li>
<li>Drop your chicken into the oil, making sure not to crowd the container or burn yourself, and let it fry for 6
minutes.  This phase cooks the chicken and starts the development of the crust on it.

<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Korean-Fried-Chicken/i-pgTpnfq/0/M/DSC_1079-M.jpg"></li>
<li>After the chicken is done frying, let it rest on a paper towel while you let the oil come back to 350 degrees.  The
second phase of the frying is also at 350 for 6 minutes.  This phase drives the last bits of moisture out of the
chicken, and crisps the crust to an unbelievable level.  It also gives the chicken a very very nice color.  Hell, the
first time I fished the chicken out of the fryer after the second fry I realized that I hadn&rsquo;t been that moved by the
sight of food in a very long time.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Korean-Fried-Chicken/i-8MVhMxG/0/M/DSC_1080-M.jpg"></li>
<li>After the second fry, let it rest on some paper towels some more.  It&rsquo;s basically ready to eat as soon as it&rsquo;s cool
to handle.  Just don&rsquo;t forget the glaze.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The first note I have is&hellip;  WARNING.  The second frying phase will be violent.  When meat finishes cooking, the
juices flow and pierce the surface, and chicken is no exception.  Since the chicken will rest at least briefly before
the second fry, that means there is actually increased moisture right under the crust, which translates to a violent,
violent time.  Seriously.  The first two minutes of this make Vesuvius look like a joke.  Drop the chicken in there
fast, and step back.  This mess is going to get raw like sushi, so haters to the left.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t think about covering it either; the moisture will get back into the oil, making it far worse when you finally
lift the cover.  You&rsquo;ll basically be staring at a Chernobyl-level thing at that point.</li>
<li>When butchering wings, the wing joints are actually fairly soft and have big spots of cartilage, making them easy
pickings for even the dullest of kitchen knives.  If you&rsquo;re still too squeamish to lift your blade and tear the wings
asunder, you have 3 options.  1)  Fry them whole.  2)  Grow a spine, pick up your sword, and slay you some chicken.
3)  Make your butcher do it, and leave them a nice tip for having to deal with your aforementioned lack of spine.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m afraid you do need a thermometer for this; trust me, I&rsquo;m an Olympic-level
too-lazy-and-cheap-to-buy-extra-equipment competitor, but in this case it really is necessary.  Just drop the $20 or
whatever and be glad you did.</li>
<li>On that note, for deep-frying I usually prefer my cast-iron pan, since it&rsquo;s heavy and holds a constant temperature
well.  In the absence of that, any good tallish heavy-bottomed pot will do, like a creuset stockpot or something.
And, in a pinch, just about any large container works&ndash;you just have to watch more carefully for fluctuations in
temperature.</li>
