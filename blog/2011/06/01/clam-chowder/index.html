<div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-6SCMhpM/0/L/DSC_0370-L.jpg"></p>

<p>This chowder is the product of &ldquo;culinary exploration&rdquo;&mdash;that is, I wanted to exercise my newly obtained booze buying
abilities in the name of good food.  I started googling around for what was usual in clam chowder, but found results
unsatisfactory.  Clam chowder with a tomato base?  Burn in hell!  I ended up deciding to take matters into my own hands
and just make things up, using nothing but my wits and the memory of chowder at Legal Seafoods.  Two trials and a bit of
hilarity later, the result is probably one of the best dishes I&rsquo;ve pulled out of thin air to date.</p>

<p>During my first trial, I used a muscat wine, which was the first thing I saw lying around the apartment.  This was a
mistake, though not a terrible one; the muscat simply had a sweet taste in its own that interfered with the flavor of
the clams.  A dry white wine, such as chardonnay or a nice sauvignon blanc, is a much better complement.</p>

<p>A blunder-turned-success occurred when I bought the clams at Shaw&rsquo;s; apparently it is customary to use bigger &ldquo;quahog&rdquo;
clams as opposed to small &ldquo;littleneck&rdquo; clams for chowder.  Based on the first trial though, I concluded that littlenecks
are preferable, at least to my tastes.  It&rsquo;s true that they don&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;punched-in-the-teeth&rdquo; strength that
quahogs do, but the flavor is more subtle and they tend to be a little sweeter.  Plus, the plucky little buggers are
cute.  So I&rsquo;m just going to pretend I knew that all along, and that I planned the choice of littlenecks over quahogs all
along.</p>

<p>How can you say no to that face?</p>

<p>And lastly&hellip;  Bacon is NOT optional here.  It&rsquo;s not.  There is no &ldquo;except&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s required.  Putting
aside the fact that not loving bacon is a cardinal sin in my book, the smokiness and pork flavor goes so well with the
clams that leaving it out is a travesty.  In fact, every time someone tries this without bacon, God beats a baby to
death with a microwave containing the remains of another baby.  You have been warned.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>15-20 littleneck clams</li>
<li>3-4 small yellow potatoes, Yukon Gold preferred, peeled and diced into &frac12; inch cubes</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
<li>3-4 thin slices bacon</li>
<li>dry white wine</li>
<li>thyme</li>
<li>milk</li>
<li>cream</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>garlic</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Boil the potatoes in a pot of salted water until cooked through and just tender.  This should only take a few
minutes.  Drain the potatoes and set aside when done.</li>
<li>While waiting on the water to boil and the potatoes to cook, remove sand from the shells of the clams.  A toothbrush
works admirably for this; a clean scouring pad will also suffice.  Brush it along the grain of the shell to get more
of the sand out and make life easier.</li>
<li>Put the clams in a large bowl with cold water to cover, and salt the water.  The salt-to-water ratio should be about
10% by volume.  Let the clams sit for about 5 minutes to allow more dirt and sand to settle to the bottom of the
bowl.</li>
<li>Drain the clams, then repeat the soaking for another 5 minutes, draining and rinsing them with more cold water when
done.</li>
<li>Heat about 2 tablespoons of butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 clove of garlic, crushed with the
flat of your blade, along with some thyme.  Dried and fresh are both acceptable, though fresh is probably easier to
work with (and remove).</li>
<li>Add the white wine, enough to come a few inches up the side of the pan and partially submerge your clams.  Let it sit
for about 2 minutes so some of the alcohol can cook off.  Add the clams, then cover the pan and let them cook.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-7Vtrx9D/0/M/DSC_0361-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Remove the clams as they open up, about 4 minutes.  Some of them might take a few minutes longer, so just let them
steam a bit more.  If they still haven&rsquo;t popped open and you&rsquo;re approaching the 8-10 minute mark though, chances are
they didn&rsquo;t make it and you should give up while you can.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-S756Fq9/0/M/DSC_0364-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Shell the clams, and set aside the liquid from the pan after filtering it to remove more sand.  For this, a fine mesh
chinois/china cap will do the job nicely.  If you&rsquo;re cheap like me, you can use a hand-held strainer lined with a
cheesecloth.  :)</li>
<li>Chop up the bacon into small pieces and fry them in a saucepan over medium-low heat.  You want the fat to start
rendering out and the bacon to cook, but not to the point where it&rsquo;s crispy.</li>
<li>Add the chopped onions to the saucepan.  If there isn&rsquo;t enough fat from the bacon, you can add a bit of oil&mdash;just
make sure it&rsquo;s an oil with little to no flavor.  Butter also works remarkably well here.  In addition to onions, you
may elect to use shallots.  I prefer to keep things simple though; this is peasant food, not fine dining.  Leeks are
also an option, but I draw a moral hardline at &ldquo;celery&rdquo; and &ldquo;carrots.&rdquo;</li>
<li>At this point, a lot of people would add flour to thicken.  While I don&rsquo;t have any issues with flour as a thickener
on principle, I disagree with its usage in this case for two reasons.  Firstly; you can always just let the chowder
reduce and thicken naturally.  This does make it contain more calories per volume, but let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves here.
It&rsquo;s a chowder, made of milk and cream and clams.  If you take down the whole pot in a meal, you&rsquo;re going to regret
it regardless of what you do.  There is also the option of cooking the potatoes more thoroughly, and using the
natural starch it releases as it melts slightly into the chowder as the thickener; this does make for really soft
melty potatoes, but I&rsquo;d really like to meet the person who eats chowder for al dente potatoes.  So I can assault him
vigorously with a rubber chicken.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to low, and allow the onions to cook slowly until translucent and slightly soft.  Add the potatoes
from earlier.</li>
<li>Add the milk and cream, enough to cover the potato/onion/bacon mix with a little bit to spare.  There should be an
equal amount of milk and cream (by volume).  Bring the mixture to a slow simmer.  Be careful not to have the heat
too high after this point; cream and milk burn pretty easily, especially if your pot is not non-stick.</li>
<li>Stir in the clam stock from before, as well as the clams.  You can either put the clams in whole, or chopped.  Or if
you&rsquo;re feeling really fancy, you can chop up 70% of them and save the rest to put on top of the chowder (I believe
the technical term here is garnish) when serving, to show that your food has Presentation and Class, and that you&rsquo;re
Moving Up In The World.</li>
<li>Let the mixture cook at a simmer, and let the chowder do its thing and thicken to an appropriately (that is,
subjectively) chowdery consistency.  At this point, you can do whatever garnishy things you feel like, including
fishing out all the pieces of bacon and frying them until crispy.  Otherwise, season with some salt and pepper, grab
a bowl, and go to town.</li>
</ol>
