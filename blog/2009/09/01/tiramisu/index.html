<div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<blockquote><p>This one holds a special place in my heart for being the first food post I ever wrote.  Tiramisu was really the first
thing that introduced me to the world of pastry, I really have my old roommate <a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a> to
thank for that.  Well, that and indirectly the entire subsequent hobby&hellip;  And probably the associated weight gain
too.</p>

<p>2009 isn&rsquo;t that long ago (2014 at the time of this comment), but it feels like ages already.  And in classic college
sophomore form, I&rsquo;m so pretentious here it hurts&hellip;  But in the interest of honesty I&rsquo;ll leave the post as-is, I
suppose.  Might update with better pictures though&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Since this is the first post with actual content in it (thereby making it the real first post), why not start off with a
bang?  Today&rsquo;s topic is&hellip;  Tiramisu.  Just for a little background&hellip;  Tiramisu is an Italian type of dessert; I&rsquo;d
probably class it as a cake.  (Yes, I know &lsquo;tiramisu&rsquo; sounds Japanese; no, it&rsquo;s Italian; yes, I&rsquo;m sure.)  But this
particular dessert has been so popular over the years that it has been adapted into cakes, puddings, and various other
forms; I find that not nearly enough people know about it in its original form anymore.  In fact, a quick google
revealed the most obscene recipes I could possibly imagine.  Only when I hit Italian Google (yeah, that&rsquo;s right) and
consulted with a European or two that I found the true classical recipe.  So without further ado&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lots of savoiardi, also known as ladyfingers</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>125g sugar (approx .63 cup)</li>
<li>400g mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>Powdered cocoa (to be sprinkled on top)</li>
<li>2 cups coffee, large</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>Bit of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<p>(The above makes enough to fill two 8inx13in glass trays.)</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>What you want to do is to get two bowls and separate the egg whites from the egg yolks.  The important part here is
to not get any yolk in the white.  Having a bit of white with your yolks is okay; obviously you don&rsquo;t want too much,
but you get the idea.</li>
<li>Next, add all your sugar and however much vanilla extract into the egg yolks and start mixing it until you get a
nice, creamy mixture.  The thing to look for here is that 1) it&rsquo;s nice and smooth, and 2) it should actually be a
slightly paler yellow than the egg yolks originally were.</li>
<li>Add the mascarpone cheese into the egg yolk-sugar mixture.  Start whisking again, until you get a homogeneous mixture
with no lumps of mascarpone in it.  Try to get it as smooth as possible.  Note:  You don&rsquo;t need exactly 400g; just
somewhere around.  Personally, I end up adding something closer to 450 most of the time anyway&hellip;  Since this doesn&rsquo;t
demand extreme precision in ingredient amount, it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s take a little break from the whisking.  Get your savoiardi and coffee out; I recommend having the coffee ready
and cooled down to at least luke-warm, since more likely than not you will end up touching it.  What you want to do
now is put the coffee in a tray or in a plate or something.  Next, dip the savoiardi into the coffee.  The key here
is that you want to soak them, but not thoroughly.  Essentially, when you dip the savoiardi the coffee will get
absorbed upwards.  When it&rsquo;s about halfway up (err on the side of more here; the only thing worse than too wet  is
too dry), take it out and lay it in the tray as shown.  The reason behind the way you soak it is that when it&rsquo;s
resting in the fridge later, capillary action will bring the coffee up further into the ladyfinger.  Not to mention
it&rsquo;ll absorb the moisture from the mascarpone filling; so it&rsquo;s all good.  And these little suckers hold a LOT more
coffee than you&rsquo;d think; we used two Large coffees from Starbucks (plain coffee, 2 bucks apiece) to soak two trays&#8217;
worth of savoiardi properly.</li>
<li>Now it&rsquo;s back to the whisk.  Here&rsquo;s the part where people either have an electric beater, or really really wish they
did.  And if there isn&rsquo;t even a whisk available&hellip;  Give up.  Right now.  Seriously.  You will hurt yourself.
Otherwise&hellip;  Toss in a pinch of salt and whisk/beat/whatever the egg whites.  They will go from transparent to
foamy, and foamy to REALLY foamy; what you&rsquo;re looking for is what chefs call a &ldquo;stiff white peak&rdquo;; if you pick some
up with your whisk/beater and you see that the egg white hangs on in a stiff manner, then it&rsquo;s ready.  (Why did we
not do this before soaking the savoiardi? Because after you whip them they start collapsing. REALLY FAST. So you&rsquo;d
have had to do it again. You don&rsquo;t want that.)</li>
<li>Slowly fold the mascarpone mixture into the egg whites.  And by slowly I mean about a spatulaful at a time.  It&rsquo;s a
VERY bad idea to plop it all in at once since that might destroy the whites and make them collapse.  And trust me,
nobody wants to hand-whisk more than one batch of egg whites at once.</li>
<li>Spread the mixture evenly across your trays of savoiardi, and then stick it in the fridge for 6-24 hours.  Ta-da!</li>
<li>When you want to serve it, sprinkle some cocoa powder on top.  You do this right before you serve since if it&rsquo;s done
beforehand, the cocoa powder will absorb moisture from the filling, and turn out a bit soggy.  It&rsquo;s not a big deal,
but hey.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can make multi-layer tiramisu with a big enough tray.  Each layer should be, from bottom to top:  savoiardi, filling, cocoa powder.  Then on the very top you can throw some chocolate or whatever if you feel like.</li>
<li>It turns out home-made savoiardi are way better than the packaged sort.  And the method behind them is amazingly simple, and the stuff is dead useful; however, I discovered this after my pilot journey with the tiramisu, so I used the packaged stuff.  The stuff is awesome though (kind of like a firmer spongecake) so I will be sure to post about it later.</li>
<li>Yes, traditionally tiramisu is made with espresso; however, espresso is just super-concentrated coffee.  I personally don&rsquo;t mind either way, but purists will insist, I suppose&hellip;</li>
</ul>
