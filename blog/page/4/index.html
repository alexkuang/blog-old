  <div class="entry-content"><p>After achieving some measure of familiarity with Scala, and with newfound copious amounts of free time, I decided I
wanted to see more of what the functional world had to offer.  The obvious choices were Haskell and Clojure; but while
Haskell has the upper hand in functional purity and a crazy advanced type system, I like to think I&rsquo;m a pragmatic guy at
heart and Clojure seemed more practical.  I haven&rsquo;t worked with it too extensively, but my experience so far can be
summarized by two words: Simple and composable.</p>

<h4>The language</h4>

<p>Clojure is a refreshingly simple language.  Despite my last foray into a Lisp being about half a decade ago, the
learning curve was much gentler than I&rsquo;d expected.  Maybe it&rsquo;s because I was already in a functional programming
mindset, but the straightforward syntax and <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/">abundance</a>
<a href="http://clojure.org/getting_started">of</a> <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">documentation</a> probably helped.  And on a
completely subjective level: <code>iDislikeCamelCase</code>, and <code>clojure-case-is-pretty-neat</code>.</p>

<h4>The ecosystem</h4>

<p>Of course, the overall enjoyability of using a language doesn&rsquo;t depend solely on the core language, but also the
libraries and toolchain available.  Most of the libraries I&rsquo;ve seen keep in line with the design of the language: super
lightweight, super simple, super composable, and as a result super easy to ramp up on and use.  Theoretically that
should just describe all good library design in general, but I feel like the clojure community takes it especially to
heart.</p>

<p>Compojure, for example, chose to implement its url
<a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Destructuring-Syntax">destructuring</a> to closely follow the destructuring
available in stock Clojure <code>let</code>s expressions.  I can&rsquo;t help but draw the comparison to Scala, where I&rsquo;d be more likely
to find that url decomposition exists only in the form of an exotic DSL.  Another huge example for me is the difference
between the simplicity of the Clojure build tool Leiningen and the craziness of Scala&rsquo;s SBT.  Sorry SBT&mdash;You work very
well, but I&rsquo;d rather not have to google what the <code>&lt;++=</code> operator does every time I touch the build.</p>

<h4>With vim</h4>

<p>One of my original reasons for leaning clojure was its close integration with
<a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/lighttable/">LightTable</a>.  As it turns out, the functionality I liked could be
replicated in vim with <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace">fireplace.vim</a>&rsquo;s quasi-insta-repl and insta-doc, due in
no small part to leiningen and nrepl&rsquo;s awesomeness.
<a href="https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim">Rainbow parentheses</a> is also pretty cool, and has been useful enough
that I will probably keep it on even when I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the hardcore levels of parens in Lisps:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/rainbow-parens.png"></p>

<h4>Overall</h4>

<p>If programming languages could be graded on usability, Clojure would get full marks.  It has been a breath of fresh air
after dealing with the crazy complexity in Scala.  Undoubtedly working through the latter had a part in making the
former much easier, and Scala will always have a place with me, but for now I find myself slowly joining the rest of the
Clojure bandwagon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, my gaming bandwidth has been taken up by the new Zelda game, A Link Between Worlds.  It&rsquo;s been a while since
my last trip to Hyrule, but I&rsquo;ve always loved the ingenuity behind the dungeons, especially the ones in Ocarina of Time
which could take upwards of hours (Water Temple, I&rsquo;m looking at you) to complete on the first run.  One of them jumps to
mind particularly: The Forest Temple, a dungeon you encounter in the early-mid game immediately after gaining access to
adult Link.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like a completely normal dungeon&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got your wolves, you&rsquo;ve got your carnivorous plants,
and the obvious puzzle in the form of 4 torches that have to be lit.  Fairly straightforward, until the game hits you
with this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/forest-temple-hallway.jpg"></p>

<p>The first time you hit the twisting hallway, you have to follow it as-is to the other side, your perspective being
warped, to end up in a room with you standing on its &ldquo;wall&rdquo;.  On the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; is a chest, inaccessible in your current
state, and further on is a door you don&rsquo;t have the key to.  After a few more rooms and a battle with some wolves, you
end up with the bow which allows you to hit a switch to un-twist the hallway, bringing a completely new
perspective to the rooms&mdash;Most obviously, the chest from the earlier &ldquo;floor&rdquo; is now reachable, and after a little
contemplation and a lot of climbing, you get the key to the previously locked door&hellip;  <em>Which you can&rsquo;t access until you
re-twist the hallway.</em></p>

<p>This simple sequence is, in essence, what makes the classical Zelda dungeons challenging and oh so much fun.  In
addition to an &ldquo;item of the moment&rdquo;, each area contains an inventive mechanic that completely changes the landscape
of the entire dungeon.  A room is completely different when your perspective is rotated, platforms become traversable
after you flood the floor with sand, and so on.  It&rsquo;s no longer just <em>Push a block over here</em>, it&rsquo;s <em>Push a block over
here to change the water level so we can push that other block, and then change the water level back to align the two
blocks properly and maybe we can finally get to that chest over there.  Oh wait, that didn&rsquo;t work, maybe if I switch the
water level back BEFORE moving the second block&hellip;</em></p>

<p>Sound familiar?  The hardest dungeons&#8217; mechanics tend to use some piece of outside state to introduce exponentially more
complex interactions between the existing items that Link already has access to.  Interactions that now depend not only
on the current environment, but also the configuration of surrounding environments, and probably the order that
everything was done as well.  Keeping track of all that is welcome, even enjoyable, when I&rsquo;m playing Zelda.  But I have
no wish to be dealing with such things when I&rsquo;m trying to make sure my code is doing what I want it to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://overwatering.org/blog/2013/12/scala-1-star-would-not-program-again/">blog post</a> has recently been making the
rounds in all the usual programming fora&mdash;/r/programming, hackernews, and so on&mdash;even eliciting a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-debate/153H3Ya4Nxk">response</a> from Scala&rsquo;s creator himself.  There&rsquo;s a
lot of discussion both productive and inflammatory out there already, but I thought I&rsquo;d jot down my perspective on the
common points as someone who: 1. picked scala up relatively recently (2.9.2 and 2.10), 2. has worked with it for a few
months on the side, and 3. comes from a background of dynamic languages.</p>

<h4>Long Compile Times</h4>

<p>I can definitely see where this is coming from.  Scala&rsquo;s compile times can be pretty long, though I had pegged that as
the cost of using a compiled language anyway.  I, at least, felt a marked increase in times upgrading from <code>2.9.2</code> to
<code>2.10</code>, presumably from the slew of new features like macros.  However, it seems that <code>2.11</code> will thankfully be
<a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/state-scala-2013">focused</a> on compiler optimizations.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve found that
judicious use of some of Scala&rsquo;s heavier features (such as implicits) keeps the compile times manageable.
<a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/">JRebel</a> has been a godsend as well for hot-reloading in incremental
compilation, and they do offer a personal Scala license for free.  Without JRebel my life as a scala user would have
been a lot harder.</p>

<h4>Opaque Syntax</h4>

<p>I agree completely here.  Scala&rsquo;s flexibility in parsing + its allowance of symbolic method names obviously allows for a
lot of flexibility.  This allows the construction of all sorts of DSLs; whether these DSLs end up being expressive or
just plain confusing, is another thing altogether.  In this case, I&rsquo;d have to say that just because something is
possible does not mean it should be done all the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past, my biggest problem with blogging has always been with finding something to write about.  Every time an idea
came, I&rsquo;d recall the original post that inspired it, or have one miraculously pop up on google upon doing more
research.  Inevitably the post would be articulate, well-researched, and laden with comments from impressed readers to
boot.  And I would hit control+w, convinced that I don&rsquo;t have anything to add; even if I did, I&rsquo;m an awful writer and
nobody reads my blog anyway.</p>

<p>But writing is an Important Skill, one that I&rsquo;d very much like to improve.  I&rsquo;m certainly not going to get any better by
<em>not</em> doing it, and <a href="http://weknowmemes.com/2012/05/sucking-at-something-is-the-first-step-to-becoming/">everyone has to start somewhere</a>: keep practicing, keep
drilling, keep jabbing away, and eventually you&rsquo;ll probably make progress.  I remember an old post of Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s
where his only advice was to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step.html">pick a schedule</a> and stick
with it.  Maybe it&rsquo;s about time I did just that.  <strong>One post a week</strong>, even if the topic sounds asinine and I&rsquo;m low on
inspiration and nobody will read it (or <em>especially</em> if nobody will read it?).</p>

<p>With all that said, I&rsquo;d like to introduce my newest housemate, <a href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Animals/Zelda">Zelda</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Animals/Zelda/i-rNGBWHH/0/L/DSC_2268-L.jpg"></p>

<p>She arrived with all of 3 days&#8217; notice, and is at just about that age where kittens tend to be terrible people.  She&rsquo;ll
bully the other (much bigger) cats, knock over bowls and trash bags, attack everything like the king of the jungle, and
just generally be an unabashed little snot.  But she&rsquo;s disarmingly adorable, so naturally none of that matters in the
slightest.</p>

<p>Last weekend I saw a giant leg of New Zealand lamb that looked way too good to pass up, crazy Whole Foods prices or not.
Huge roasted joints of meat are always a win with me but I strongly prefer bone in; there&rsquo;s just so much more flavor
that way.  I took the basic steps from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvEdCmD8Pk">this video</a> by Thomas Keller, using
an oven temp of 325 for ~1hr and frenching the tip of the bone to aid in carving.  I finished the last few minutes with
a cranked up broiler to really get a nice crust on the surface.</p>

<p>There was one problem I had with the conventional wisdom, though: laying the herbs on/around the meat and just seasoning
the surface doesn&rsquo;t seem like it would be enough to really get that taste in there, especially with something this
thick.  So I took a cue from how cloves are used in ham, substituting the cloves for garlic and the ham joint for a lamb
leg.  Spearing the garlic with small sprigs of rosemary added just the right extra punch, and ended up staining the
garlic green as a bonus.</p>

<p>I would consider this experiment a success.  Embedding the garlic really gets the flavor into the meat, and the rosemary
adds a lot to the presentation as well. If nothing else, it can be an excuse to crack some Monty Python shrubbery jokes
at the dinner table.  Chances to do that don&rsquo;t come around nearly as often as they should.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was going to test out some of the codeblock functionality in octopress, but as it turns out the fancy stuff I wanted

<p>Nothing fancy, just one of many possible variations of the fibonacci sequence.  This one is done via a <code>Stream</code>,
which is Scala&rsquo;s memoized lazily evaluated list.  (<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream">More here</a>).</p>

<p>Will probably write more about the why/how of the nested loop <code>def</code> (mostly for my own reference), but for now I think
the codeblock looks pretty neat.  It&rsquo;s still a shame I didn&rsquo;t get to play with funny line numbers/highlighting stuff
though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&hellip; Or, &ldquo;How I Chose a Blog Platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Multiple people have said that I should get back into writing, so I guess I&rsquo;m back into the blogging scene now.  It&rsquo;s
true I did have a food blog before a particular work project completely pole-axed it, and I would love to start it up
again.  The problem is that WordPress has always been a bit cumbersome for me so this time around I wanted something
different.  Plus I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get into the whole tech/misc blogging thing.  So I set out to find something that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is easy to write in.  I&rsquo;d been fascinated by the idea of blogging in Markdown, so preferably that.</li>
<li>Could render code snippets / do syntax highlighting in most major languages.</li>
<li>Could display pictures with reasonable flexibility and prettiness.</li>
<li>Supported some form of organization based on categories/tags.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://telegr.am/">telegr.am</a> was a strong contender for a while, since it uses Markdown and is written in <code>Scala</code> and
thus would have been familiar ground, but sadly it was missing in some key features.  All the other frameworks I found
were either lackluster, pay-only, or required self-deployment on a server, which I&rsquo;m clearly too lazy to do nowadays.
Thus I came to settle on <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, a framework based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which I
had already played with for my personal site before.  Thus far it fits the bill nearly perfectly, with the only rub
being the heavy dependency on git (or in my particular case, github).  But that isn&rsquo;t really a problem unless I ever
want a blog with non-technical contributors, so that bridge can be crossed when the time comes.</p>

<p>TL;DR &ndash; New blog.  Pardon the appearance during construction.</p>

<blockquote><p>This was the first actual post I&rsquo;d written in a while that wasn&rsquo;t a banal restaurant review, in an attempt to start up
the whole blogging in thing again.  Too bad Meaningful Use at work started really kicking in at that time, and I
realized how much of a painful time suck it was to wrangle wordpress, so this was the last post on the old blog before I
took the server down and stopped writing altogether.  It&rsquo;s all very sad.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Beef-Shank/i-RKjGV2B/0/L/DSC_1888-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Braised beef shank is another favorite from my childhood that I commonly found as an appetizer at banquet-style dinners,
though it isn&rsquo;t really a braised dish in the traditional western sense.  It isn&rsquo;t served with the braising liquid, and
it doesn&rsquo;t aim to fall apart on the fork; quite the opposite, actually.  The shank is boiled in a mixture of soy sauce
and aromatic spices, then sliced thinly and served cold.  The end result is a great example of a cut of meat that is
usually tough and cheap being transformed into something wonderfully flavorful by a bit of time and ingenuity.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Two beef shanks</li>
<li>1.5 cup dark soy sauce</li>
<li>3 cups water</li>
<li>6 star anise</li>
<li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
<li>10-12 sichuan peppercorns</li>
<li>5 cloves</li>
<li>1 inch piece peeled ginger</li>
<li>2-3 pieces rock sugar; otherwise, 2 tbsp table sugar</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, and simmer the meat in it for about 5 minutes, then rinse with cold water.  This
helps get rid of some of the gameyness and clean up the flavor a little.</li>
<li>Place everything (the meat, soy sauce, water, and spices) into a pot and bring to a boil.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Beef-Shank/i-td3L4V7/0/M/DSC_1873-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Simmer on a low heat for about 2-3 hours.</li>
<li>Let everything cool, and stick it in the fridge overnight.  This step is not optional; the beef shanks will be
infinitely easier to slice once cooled, and the extra time will let the flavors soak in properly.  In addition, the
tendons in the shank will have time to set, adding to its unique chewy texture.</li>
<li>Slice thinly against the grain of the shank.  If you&rsquo;re not sure which way that is, think of taking cross-sections of
a tree, except instead of counting the rings this time you&rsquo;re looking to see the meat fibers and bits of tendon.
Make sure the slices are thin, about 1/8 inch or thinner.  Beef shank is a naturally tough cut; the thinner the
slices, the shorter the meat sinews, the easier it will be to eat.</li>
<li>Serve cold, preferably with a drizzle of sesame oil or some sesame seeds on top, maybe a few chopped scallions.  Or
just dunk it into a hot bowl of noodle soup, whatever works.</li>
<li>(Optional) Save the braising liquid to use as the base for a future project.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Although I provide a list of ingredients, it is by no means gospel; everyone I&rsquo;ve ever known has used slightly different
ingredients in slightly varying amounts.  Likewise, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world if a few ingredients are missing or
have to be substituted, although all of the above list should be available at any decent Chinese grocer, or Amazon when
all else fails.  Dark soy sauce, which is similar to light soy sauce except fermented with a few extra ingredients and
for longer, yielding a richer and less salty product, can ostensibly be replaced with regular soy sauce and more sugar
(caveat: I&rsquo;ve never tried this myself, so I have no idea how it will go&mdash;most places that sell soy sauce will sell dark
soy sauce anyway).  Rock sugar can be replaced by table sugar with negligible difference.  Other aromatics like
cardamom, fivespice powder, or orange peel can be mixed in.  I would really caution against adding too many cloves,
though; they have a tendency to overpower other ingredients very quickly.</p>

<p>The other thing worth mentioning is that the braising liquid can also work for other meats.  Chicken thighs and
drumsticks work with this flavor very well, and eggs can be used as well as sort of variation on tea eggs.  A personal
favorite of mine is pork tongue (I recommend the same boiling + slicing procedure, though with thicker slices and served
hot), which arguably works even better than beef shank.  It has an awesome flavor in addition to being available in
plentiful supply for a cheap price, and I love the insane contrast between a horror-movie-esque pork tongue sitting on
the cutting board and the same tongue ready to serve and neatly sliced on a plate moments later.  Seriously though, pork
tongue has an amazing flavor and texture, and everyone should try it at least once.</p>

<blockquote><p>Holy crap, it&rsquo;s been way too long since I&rsquo;ve made these&hellip;  Seeing this post reminds me that this dough seems vaguely
similar to the Morning Bun at Oleana.  Applying this dough to a similar pull-apart-bread-ish procedure has been on my
todo list for a while now.  Plus I still haven&rsquo;t done the cardamom variation I mentioned at the end of the post.  A
good idea for summer, perhaps.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Cinnamon-Rolls/i-FCvsSfX/0/L/DSC_1430-L.jpg"></p>

<p>This is another recipe I started working on due to what I like to call the &ldquo;American Bakery Syndrome&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the
majority of what I can buy in stores sucks.  In this case, for the most part I&rsquo;ve found that they&rsquo;ve tasted soggy, and
more of sugar syrup than cinnamon.  That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t have a sweet tooth&mdash;quite the opposite.  But my stance
here is much like the one I take for excessive use of hot sauce&mdash;sure, it tastes like something, but it&rsquo;s still boring,
stupid, and lazy.</p>

<p>Here are the basics.  Cinnamon rolls are viennoiserie; simply put, that means they&rsquo;re sort of the bastard child of bread
and more conventional pastry.  This means there is fermenting dough involved, and you will need time to do this
properly.  You can, as usual, cut on the time, but the flavor won&rsquo;t be as nice.  For people working the 9-5, I recommend
starting the dough in the morning, and finishing everything after getting home from work.  The fermented dough is then
rolled out, sprinkled with filling, and rolled up and cut into small buns.  The full form of this roll that I originally
used comes with a glaze, but since development I haven&rsquo;t put them together; the combination of the sugar and butter in
the roll, cinnamon filling AND the glaze is potent enough to violate the Geneva Convention.  As for the icing crap on
top&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe in it.  It clobbers any nice feeling from the bun and cinnamon with massive amounts of unwarranted
sugar.  You can do it if you want, just don&rsquo;t tell me about it.</p>

<h3>Ingredients (dough)</h3>

<ul>
<li>400g bread flour</li>
<li>100g cake flour (AP works as well)</li>
<li>200g warm water</li>
<li>75g egg (About 1.5 large eggs; see procedure for what to do with the leftover partial egg)</li>
<li>100g sugar</li>
<li>8g salt</li>
<li>10g yeast</li>
<li>150g butter, room temperature (or melted)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ingredients (filling)</h3>

<p>The main thing to understand about the filling is the proportions.  The basic formula is 100g brown sugar for 100g sugar
for 6g cinnamon.  However, how much you actually use is basically up to your personal tastes, and how diabetic you feel
like getting after eating a batch.  For the dough quantity above, a full amount would probably be something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>25g brown sugar</li>
<li>25g sugar</li>
<li>1.5g cinnamon</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Mix the dry ingredients together, and add the water.  Mix until it&rsquo;s just starting to come together.</li>
<li>If you chose to melt the butter for time constraints, mix it in slowly so you don&rsquo;t have a large quantity of hot
butter touching the dough at any given time.  If the butter is at room temp, chop it into small &frac12; inch cubes and
incorporate into the dough slowly.</li>
<li>Mix/knead the dough until the gluten is well-formed, and you have a solid ball of dough.  This takes roughly 5
minutes on medium speed on a kitchenaid with a dough hook, but may take longer if you&rsquo;re doing it by hand.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the fridge &ldquo;overnight&rdquo;&mdash;this means 4 hours minimum, 10 hours
maximum by my reckoning.</li>
<li>Take the dough out, and let it sit for about 45 minutes so the butter in the dough softens and it becomes more
workable.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough into a rectangle, and mix up your filling.</li>
<li>Brush the entire surface of the dough with water, and sprinkle on the filling.  I prefer using a sieve for an even
distribution.  MAKE SURE to leave a small strip of dough, about 1-2 inches, at the edge that has water but no
filling, so that when you roll it up it seals properly.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Cinnamon-Rolls/i-7wFtjKw/0/M/DSC_1419-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Roll the rectangle up into a big log, and cut into small rolls.  Rest them on their sides on a baking pan lined with
parchment paper.  In the meantime, pre-heat your oven to 385 F.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Cinnamon-Rolls/i-VCC3Pzv/0/M/DSC_1420-M.jpg"></li>
<li>(OPTIONAL)  At this point you can give the rolls a good coating of eggwash (this is a good opportunity to use up that
spare egg from above).  It doesn&rsquo;t really affect the taste (unless you screw up) but it definitely goes miles in
terms of presentation.  Everyone has different formulas for eggwash and as far as I can tell it doesn&rsquo;t make too much
of a difference, but I like using whole eggs cut with a tiny tiny bit of cream.  The only thing you have to watch out
for is that you have to beat the eggs properly before using them.  If you don&rsquo;t, then the eggwash turns out uneven
and it will look like shit.  This means your eggs have to be fully runny, with no bits of stringy cohesive white or
whatever in there at all.  Another small thing is to not put on too much; if you have your buns lying in a giant pool
of egg, then the pool of egg will brown (or even worse, burn) in the oven, imparting a nasty taste to your buns.</li>
<li>Let the rolls proof for about 1.5 to 2 hours.  How long this takes depends, again, on the temperature; the cooler it
is, the longer it takes.  A good rule of thumb is just to wait until it&rsquo;s about 1.5x to 2x their original size, and
have softened up considerably.  Unless there is no change after 2+ hours, in which case something is terribly
terribly wrong; perhaps you didn&rsquo;t use enough yeast, or killed them off somehow.  Another good indicator is if the
middle of the rolls are slightly pushed up due to the expansion, and if any excess water you brushed on earlier gets
squeezed out as well.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Cinnamon-Rolls/i-KkDnkr6/0/M/DSC_1421-M.jpg"></li>
<li>(OPTIONAL) Right before putting the rolls into the oven, throw on a second coating of eggwash.  Why two?  It gives
it more color and more depth, and if you&rsquo;re going to go to the trouble of doing eggwash, might as well do it
properly.  If you&rsquo;re really lazy, you can skip the first coating from above and just do this one.</li>
<li>Bake at 386F for about 13-15 minutes.  The time it takes depends on the size of the rolls and everything, but I
recommend checking on them after 13 minutes and deciding how much longer based on how they&rsquo;re looking.</li>
</ol>


<p>And there you have it.  Not that hard, aye?  There&rsquo;s not even a need for a Notes section, since this is a fairly
straightforward (if time-consuming) process.  Anything that can go wrong in terms of rolling, shaping, etc, all comes
down to practice, so there really isn&rsquo;t much I can say in a broad sense to remedy that.</p>

<p>One interesting note though, is that there is a Swedish-Slash-Scandinavian version of this that infuses the filling with
cardamom, and tops the bun with tiny bits of pearl sugar.  It&rsquo;s a bit unusual, but tasty nonetheless.  I may try
reproducing it one day.</p>
