<p>Alright, so I cheated a little bit.  Despite extensive (not really) research, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything in the top google
results for Australian that really clicked.  At least, anything using conventional ingredients; I didn&rsquo;t quite get the
chance to special-order some kangaroo.  Since I&rsquo;m told meat pies are popular in Australia and the lamb was technically
from there, it still counts&hellip;  Right?</p>

<p><em>What?!  A food post that isn&rsquo;t themed?!</em>  That&rsquo;s right.  While the 52weeks deal resulted in consistency, doing only
those posts all the time got a bit stale, so I decided to go a bit off the beaten path.  This dish was inspired by what
is still one of the coolest videos I&rsquo;ve ever seen: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAekQ5fzfGM">Jacques Pepin deboning an entire chicken</a>.
A Galantine is a French (big surprise) technique where all of the bones are removed from a chicken, but the meat and
skin is kept intact like the remains of some sort of creepy skinwalker type transformation.   Everything is then
stuffed, rolled up, and roasted.</p>

<p>Despite its simplicity, it&rsquo;s one of the coolest techniques I have ever seen, and it makes carving much much easier
since you don&rsquo;t have any bones to contend with while grappling a hot chicken fresh out of the oven.  I&rsquo;ve only done this
a few times, and it&rsquo;s already become my de-facto method for preparing whole chicken&mdash;the cool factor, the corpse
desecration, the ease of plating&hellip;  What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve been to Anime Boston, or any other sort of nerdy/geeky gathering.  Maybe it was me drifting
away from the subculture and slowly becoming a filthy casual.  Maybe it was moving 40 miles &lt;&ndash; that way and not having a
car.  Or maybe it was the fact that they switched from nifty plastic convention badges to the slightly ghetto
paper-in-sleeve setup that they still had going this year.  For those who remember the cards&mdash;<em>yes, it&rsquo;s been that
long.</em></p>

<p>So when I was dropping by Copley this weekend to revisit some old watering holes and found out the convention was in
town, I figured why not?  I had some time to kill, and the registration lines looked pretty short.  I ended up only
staying the afternoon since my con-going stamina isn&rsquo;t what it used to be <em>(refer above to casual status)</em>, but here are
some quick impressions.</p>

<p>Garlic is such an ubiquitous ingredient that I could have easily <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2013/11/17/roast-leg-of-lamb/">cheated</a>
my way around this week&rsquo;s theme.  But where&rsquo;s the fun in that?  In the end, the decision came down to the deliciousness
of garlic bread and my curiosity for the concept of &ldquo;pull-apart bread&rdquo;, something that has been on the rise on
instagrammy/pinteresty/otherwise-artsy-craftsy sites lately.  The result was the above: some sort of garlic pull-apart
boule that&rsquo;s kind of a cross between your typical &ldquo;pull-apart bread&rdquo; and a hasselback potato.</p>

<p><em>Mind of a Chef</em> is not just great background noise for getting work done, it also pads out the list of cool and
unusual things I&rsquo;d like to try in the kitchen.  Out of all the things I&rsquo;d seen on the show, making gnocchi out of ramen
seemed among the most unusual and also among the simplest, so I decided it would be a prime target for this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;TV
Show Inspired&rdquo; theme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Normally I try to keep the &ldquo;dear diary&rdquo; factor on the blog low.  But in all the bustle of settling back into the east
coast with a new work arrangement, I all but forgot about the whole blogging thing until roughly 2 minutes ago.  So if
you&rsquo;re one of the ones who reads this for what little informational value I manage to provide, or are otherwise
uninterested in participating in this rare bout of masturbatory self-congratulations, here&rsquo;s your cue.</p>

<p>Still here?  So&hellip;  I got my blue belt in BJJ recently.  For anyone unfamiliar, it&rsquo;s basically the &ldquo;hurrah, you&rsquo;re no
longer a rookie&rdquo; rank, and in all seriousness this is one of my prouder moments.  Why?  Because of all my regular
activities, BJJ is the one where I have absolutely no talent whatsoever.  Seriously.  It took me a solid 2 years to get
to this point, and every day of that was spent with the mat being wiped by my face.  Ask anyone at the gym: I still get
rag-dolled on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Now, as a software developer (and all-around lazy nerd) I have a propensity to approach most problems by a) finding an
easier way to do it, b) deciding it&rsquo;s not worth the time, or c) see (a).  It&rsquo;s an approach that works for software, for
games, and probably for most challenges you&rsquo;re likely to find in the first world.  But it&rsquo;s great having proof that
sometimes you just have to show up and grind through and that&rsquo;s the only way to improve.  It&rsquo;s a reminder that
surprisingly often, the only actual obstacle is just you being a giant chicken and unwilling to leave your comfort zone.</p>

<p>So, as the kid who couldn&rsquo;t do a single push-up and ran a 13 minute mile in school, I&rsquo;d like to give myself a pat on the
back for managing to get this far.  And despite all the split lips, swollen fingers, and sprained joints, I sure hope I
get a lot farther in the future.</p>

<p>Oh, and&hellip;  I kind of lied about the lack of material.  I had another 52-weeks post lined up, but the experiment failed
horribly.  I&rsquo;m just buying time so I can do a second iteration and save SOME face, so&hellip;  Look forward to that one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my last day on my trip to the West Coast, and I&rsquo;ve just finished packing, so what better time to make sure I meet
my self-imposed weekly blog quota?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be perfectly honest here: I find poaching to be kind of boring in and of itself.  Most of the time I see it used
as an excuse for health nuts to abandon any semblance of flavor, and I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I wouldn&rsquo;t likely prefer
whatever is being served to be deep fried instead.  That said, there are cases where poaching a protein can be
delicious.  Salmon is usually a good bet, and poaching a whole chicken can make for some awesome soup as long as
care is taken not to overcook it.  I chose to go with something simpler this week&mdash;a poached egg&mdash;since it&rsquo;s dead easy
and there&rsquo;s very little that matches the luxury of a runny yolk.  The corn with miso butter for this particular setup is
shamelessly stolen from David Chang&rsquo;s <em>Mind of a Chef</em>.  (Which, by the way, for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t watched&mdash;I highly
recommend it.)</p>

<p>Living out of a hotel room in San Francisco makes it pretty hard to complete any sort of themed cooking challenge.
Luckily, I had the wherewithal to go one or two challenges ahead and snap up some appropriate pictures.  Unluckily, I
was a dunce and left the notes on the ingredient amounts at home&hellip;  Times like this I wish that Octopress had a proper
draft feature so I could just write the entire post out ahead of time.  As it is, everyone will have to settle for a
<a href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Jamaican-Beef-Patty/i-LsmL2g8">photo</a> of the meez for &frac12; lb of beef, and some
quick notes from memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>The seasonings in the photo are salt, allspice, paprika, garlic, scotch bonnets, and thyme.  Basically, the beginnings
of a slightly ghetto jerk seasoning.</li>
<li>The crust was built kind of like your standard shortcrust pie dough.  The only thing is that I found a lot of places
recommending vegetable shortening.  We don&rsquo;t abide by shortening in my house, so I just replaced it with a slightly
smaller quantity of butter.  It also contained a bit of turmeric, hence the brilliant yellow color.</li>
<li>Prep was simple: saute everything, wrap in dough, bake at 375 for about 25 minutes.</li>
</ul>


<p>The result tasted just about how you&rsquo;d expect the above combination to taste: like a curry beef pie.  I&rsquo;d shaped these
into a rough slightly-bigger-than-pierogi sort of shape, but that left an unsatisfying amount of filling per bite.  Next
time I&rsquo;d probably go with something like McDonald&rsquo;s Apple Pie size.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even with that hypothetical improvement I found the patties a bit flat and boring.  I guess it&rsquo;s because
curry meat pie-like constructs were a mainstay of my childhood, and most of the time the Chinese version was made with
puff pastry which I vastly prefer to shortcrust.  Plus, I&rsquo;ve read that the most common way to eat the Jamaican patties
is stuffed inside coco-bread (a soft roll made with coconut milk), and the thought of the bread starch on top of the
crust starch just grosses me out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been nearly two years since I&rsquo;ve done any serious baking and pastry work.  One part of it was graduating into a
full-time job that meant most of my time would be spent away in an office instead of at home keeping an eye on my dough
or batter or what have you.  The other part is my current apartment&rsquo;s oven being&hellip;  How do I put this politely&hellip;  a
piece of shit.</p>

<p>But the other day&rsquo;s challenge with the panna cotta ended up rousing the baker in me more than I&rsquo;d expected, and when
everyone around me started discussing macarons, I had a pretty bad case of my equivalent of the withdrawal shakes.  So I
figured I&rsquo;d take a shot at beating my oven into submission; after all, even with a proper oven I&rsquo;d MacGuyver&rsquo;d my way
out of worse things back in school.  The result?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-Bb46M8t/0/L/macred1-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Far from perfect, but it&rsquo;s good to know that my hands haven&rsquo;t completely rusted off.  And with the recent changes in
lifestyle, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to get back into more interesting experimentation as well; just have to be more
careful about not repeating the college experience and gaining a ton of weight along the way.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-tR5PPpB/0/L/macred2-L.jpg"></p>

<p>A shot of the shells as a bonus.  My piping still kind of sucks and I definitely need to practice and tweak more, but
overall it could have been much worse.</p>

<p>The few times I&rsquo;ve used vanilla have always been for dessert, so for this week&rsquo;s challenge I really wanted to try
something savory.  Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything that didn&rsquo;t sound horrifying even in my head, so I ended
up going with a dessert anyway; tough nuts.  To be fair though, I stuck with the spirit of leaving my comfort zone and
made multiple things I&rsquo;ve never done before&mdash;panna cotta and apple compote.</p>
