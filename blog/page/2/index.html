  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, one of our tech leads at work previewed <a href="https://github.com/ogrodnek/analog-metrics-talk">a talk</a> that he&rsquo;s
planning to give on analog metrics for the upcoming Strange Loop conference.  I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play with
microcontrollers, and this really gave me a kick in the pants to get started.  Since I had a bit of amazon credit lying
around, I decided to buy an arduino starter kit with all sorts of buttons, lights, and doo-dads, but not enough power to
actually fry anything (I hope).  I still can&rsquo;t tell my head from my ass, but so far I can make a button turn on an LED.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was dragged somewhat skeptically to a honey store.  Yep, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;a honey store.  A store, that&rsquo;s
dedicated to honey.  I know.  Strange as it may sound, it&rsquo;s actually a thing.  But after my (thus far only) trip,
I&rsquo;m a convert.</p>

<p>I was really looking forward to the Molecular theme, since I&rsquo;d been itching to play with some of this newfangled
Modernist Cuisine stuff for a while now.  So I went ahead and ordered a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Pantry-Spherification-Kit/dp/B008657GS0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401210725&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=spherification+kit">spherification kit</a>
from amazon, and came up with the idea of pairing spheres with oysters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dark Souls 2 is a great game.  Let&rsquo;s get that out of the way.  I&rsquo;ve logged low 3 digits in hours of gameplay, and made
it through the game multiple times.  The combat system is tuned, there&rsquo;s a ton of content, and multiplayer is pretty fun
(or at least, it was at the levels I hung around).  But I still prefer the original, and Demon&rsquo;s Souls, over it.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s just after I dish out a healthy dose of self-deprecation about restaurant writing that I feel compelled
to write about another restaurant.  So I&rsquo;ll keep it short.</p>

<p>I went to Daniel Patterson&rsquo;s Coi recently.  The only thing I can say about the food is that it wasn&rsquo;t overtly
over-the-top.  Nor was it deliberately modernist or filled with crazy techniques using chemicals I can&rsquo;t pronounce.  But
it was very very delicious and still managed to surprise me.  I can&rsquo;t overstate how awesome this is, and would recommend
the trip to anyone given to spending unhealthy amounts of money on food.</p>

<p>Also bought a signed copy of the book while I was there.  I can&rsquo;t wait to read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were shooting the shit in the gym on Thursday, when the subject of wasted memberships came up.  As I&rsquo;m sure is common
in any other type of service with a monthly membership, we apparently have a fair amount of people who pay for an
unlimited pass but only show up once every two weeks or so.  Or even people who pay for a membership and just don&rsquo;t show
up at all.  This isn&rsquo;t such a big deal at a place where the monthly fee is $10, but for BJJ gyms in metropolitan areas,
the costs tend to fall somewhere between $100-$200 / month.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty significant amount of money.  So why would people spend it for a service they&rsquo;re not bothering to use?
Sure, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;one year&rdquo; contract for the gym, but owners tend to be understanding most of the time, and the effort in
canceling that is pretty trivial.  I think the real barrier is in the way people think about quitting.</p>

<p>When we pick up a hobby and things get serious, it starts working its way into our definitions of ourselves.  This is
especially true for something like jiu jitsu, which involves a heavy investment and intrinsically comes with rewards
like &ldquo;higher self confidence&rdquo;, but it also applies to anything from learning a new language to picking up an instrument
to experimenting with painting.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s only natural that when life starts getting in the way, we cling onto that image.  Maybe we go from every day to
only a few times a week.  Then once a week.  Then once a month.  Then <em>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m learning to speak Spanish, but
it&rsquo;s been a few months since I&rsquo;ve had the chance to practice&hellip;&rdquo;</em>  But we rarely ever cross the threshold into
consciously declaring that we&rsquo;ve quit.  Are you still really playing the guitar if it&rsquo;s been six months since you&rsquo;ve
touched it?  One year?  Three?</p>

<p>Canceling a membership requires the conscious decision that <em>yes, I&rsquo;ve quit</em>.  But we never really seem to cross that
point.  It&rsquo;s always one rationalization after another.  Perhaps if we&rsquo;re could be more honest with ourselves, we could
save a lot of the resources that that costs us, whether that be a monthly membership fee that could be better put
towards something else, or the energy and creativity spent in thinking up justifications for ourselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In some ways, the curehappiness backports came at the perfect time, since I&rsquo;d been looking for something to sharpen my
vim skills on.  Technically I work in vim day-to-day, but usually the rest of the mental activity involved with coding
end up pushing my vim-awareness more to the side than I&rsquo;d like.  This backport, however, was heavy on repetition but
otherwise braindead, so it made the perfect set of practice exercises.  And since I had such fun (hey, it was a really
boring Sunday afternoon&hellip;), I figured I&rsquo;d share in case anyone else finds this useful&mdash;or even better, has suggestions
to make similar tasks more efficient in the future.  Please note that this is a rather quick fly-by and assumes moderate
familiarity with vim mechanics.  I&rsquo;ll probably do more slow, detailed posts in the future&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For anyone unfamiliar, I wrote a food blog a while back called curehappiness with my then-roommate,
<a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a>.  It was active mostly during my college years, dying down due to a whole variety of
reasons&mdash;office life, apathy at the post-grad lifestyle, wordpress being a pain&hellip;  All that great stuff.  The project
had originally started as an off-the-cuff idea for something to do with a newly commissioned server; after a while, I
decided to shuffle up my server arrangements, and curehappiness&#8217; Wordpress installation got the axe.  Since I couldn&rsquo;t
be bothered to backup the entire WP install, I just saved a bunch of the posts in HTML form instead, with the idea of
one day porting it to whatever new platform I would be running.</p>

<p>After all this time on Octopress + Github Pages, I finally pulled the trigger.  All the backported posts will be from
before 2013, tagged as <code>ch-backports</code>, and will contain a link at the top to this post.  They&rsquo;ve largely been preserved
verbatim, minus a few corrections like &lsquo;boal&rsquo; &ndash;> &lsquo;bowl&rsquo; (seriously, past Alex???).  However, I couldn&rsquo;t resist adding
small notes from the future, which will be in blockquotes at the top:</p>

<blockquote><p>like so.</p></blockquote>

<p>I ported the posts with the most worthwhile content&mdash;namely, recipes and records of experiments.  Restaurant reviews and
other such content were few and far between, and honestly aside from a couple of wisecracks and some nice pictures, they
felt pretty banal; not a solid reason for censorship, granted, but I still felt it wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort.  I&rsquo;ll
probably upload the photos from those posts to smugmug at some point and save the rewrites for when I have actual
original insights beyond &ldquo;yes, the food was good&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As a final note, migrating was not trivial, but I did get some nice hackery out of it.  I&rsquo;ll probably post the
tech-gorey details later, but suffice to say that I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson about storing data in arbitrary mangled html
generated by a WYSIWYG editor run through who knows how many plugins and themes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, we had a &ldquo;hack day&rdquo; at work.  Or more precisely, two hack days.  I think the name is pretty
self-explanatory&mdash;work on whatever you want, which can be something helpful to or completely unrelated to your currently
assigned tasks, as long as it&rsquo;s something interesting.  Now, &ldquo;hack time&rdquo; is a pretty established institution in the
software world, especially amongst the hip startuppy companies.  I&rsquo;m sure everyone has heard of Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; idea
by now, and the story of Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox starting as a side-project.  Proponents (especially those who are trying to
pitch a business case to managers with varying degrees of pointy-haired-ness) cite building camaraderie, stimulating
creativity, and increasing morale as some of the biggest benefits.</p>

<p>None of this is news.  But I came away this week with a surprising realization.  When coding professionally for business
use cases, things like resilience and stability are often at the top of the requirement list&mdash;Or at least, I&rsquo;d really
hope so.  If it&rsquo;s not, kindly give me the name of your company so I know what stock to not buy ;).  To this end, coding
is never as simple as just sitting down and banging away at a keyboard.  It involves testing, discussions, design,
thinking, more testing, more thinking, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  These are all very, very good things.  But I, at least, was surprised at how nice it was to just
sit down and bang away at a keyboard with abandon.  It sounds rather obvious in hindsight, but compared to the usual
rigorously managed process of software development at work, it&rsquo;s super liberating to just cowboy out some code with no
considerations other than speed and getting the job done.  And what&rsquo;s more, I realized that I had constrained myself to
the same careful management in all of my personal projects as well, especially when prototyping out potential MVPs and
such.  Again&mdash;Definitely a good thing, in most cases.  But after this week I&rsquo;m thinking that injecting some &ldquo;hack
day&rdquo;-ish time into my personal projects is in order, if for no reason other than to let the crazy out.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> &ndash; Hack days are awesome.  I should do more of them.</p>
