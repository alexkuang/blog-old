  <div class="entry-content"><p>For anyone unfamiliar, I wrote a food blog a while back called curehappiness with my then-roommate,
<a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a>.  It was active mostly during my college years, dying down due to a whole variety of
reasons&mdash;office life, apathy at the post-grad lifestyle, wordpress being a pain&hellip;  All that great stuff.  The project
had originally started as an off-the-cuff idea for something to do with a newly commissioned server; after a while, I
decided to shuffle up my server arrangements, and curehappiness&#8217; Wordpress installation got the axe.  Since I couldn&rsquo;t
be bothered to backup the entire WP install, I just saved a bunch of the posts in HTML form instead, with the idea of
one day porting it to whatever new platform I would be running.</p>

<p>After all this time on Octopress + Github Pages, I finally pulled the trigger.  All the backported posts will be from
before 2013, tagged as <code>ch-backports</code>, and will contain a link at the top to this post.  They&rsquo;ve largely been preserved
verbatim, minus a few corrections like &lsquo;boal&rsquo; &ndash;> &lsquo;bowl&rsquo; (seriously, past Alex???).  However, I couldn&rsquo;t resist adding
small notes from the future, which will be in blockquotes at the top:</p>

<blockquote><p>like so.</p></blockquote>

<p>I ported the posts with the most worthwhile content&mdash;namely, recipes and records of experiments.  Restaurant reviews and
other such content were few and far between, and honestly aside from a couple of wisecracks and some nice pictures, they
felt pretty banal; not a solid reason for censorship, granted, but I still felt it wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort.  I&rsquo;ll
probably upload the photos from those posts to smugmug at some point and save the rewrites for when I have actual
original insights beyond &ldquo;yes, the food was good&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As a final note, migrating was not trivial, but I did get some nice hackery out of it.  I&rsquo;ll probably post the
tech-gorey details later, but suffice to say that I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson about storing data in arbitrary mangled html
generated by a WYSIWYG editor run through who knows how many plugins and themes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, we had a &ldquo;hack day&rdquo; at work.  Or more precisely, two hack days.  I think the name is pretty
self-explanatory&mdash;work on whatever you want, which can be something helpful to or completely unrelated to your currently
assigned tasks, as long as it&rsquo;s something interesting.  Now, &ldquo;hack time&rdquo; is a pretty established institution in the
software world, especially amongst the hip startuppy companies.  I&rsquo;m sure everyone has heard of Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; idea
by now, and the story of Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox starting as a side-project.  Proponents (especially those who are trying to
pitch a business case to managers with varying degrees of pointy-haired-ness) cite building camaraderie, stimulating
creativity, and increasing morale as some of the biggest benefits.</p>

<p>None of this is news.  But I came away this week with a surprising realization.  When coding professionally for business
use cases, things like resilience and stability are often at the top of the requirement list&mdash;Or at least, I&rsquo;d really
hope so.  If it&rsquo;s not, kindly give me the name of your company so I know what stock to not buy ;).  To this end, coding
is never as simple as just sitting down and banging away at a keyboard.  It involves testing, discussions, design,
thinking, more testing, more thinking, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  These are all very, very good things.  But I, at least, was surprised at how nice it was to just
sit down and bang away at a keyboard with abandon.  It sounds rather obvious in hindsight, but compared to the usual
rigorously managed process of software development at work, it&rsquo;s super liberating to just cowboy out some code with no
considerations other than speed and getting the job done.  And what&rsquo;s more, I realized that I had constrained myself to
the same careful management in all of my personal projects as well, especially when prototyping out potential MVPs and
such.  Again&mdash;Definitely a good thing, in most cases.  But after this week I&rsquo;m thinking that injecting some &ldquo;hack
day&rdquo;-ish time into my personal projects is in order, if for no reason other than to let the crazy out.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> &ndash; Hack days are awesome.  I should do more of them.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s time for yet another episode of &ldquo;As [I Have] Seen On TV&rdquo;!  This time, I draw inspiration from Ramsay&rsquo;s Great
Escape, in which Gordon gets tired of his financial troubles and career as a TV chef and so decides to&hellip;  Go off to
make more TV.  Go figure.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be <em>that</em> Asian who posts a chicken wing recipe involving some combination of garlic, soy, and honey.
Next thing you know I&rsquo;ll be writing book reviews for the Joy Luck Club and acting in sketches about Tiger Moms.  Though
I suppose the latter would be pretty entertaining&hellip;</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first chicken wing recipe I&rsquo;ve posted <em>(note to self: still need to port those old entries over&hellip;)</em>, but
it is a pretty quick and easy one.  The only awkward part is that in situations like this, it&rsquo;s not worth the effort to
not make a ton, but then everything takes a while to eat&hellip;  But I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good problem to have.</p>

<p>Alright, so I cheated a little bit.  Despite extensive (not really) research, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything in the top google
results for Australian that really clicked.  At least, anything using conventional ingredients; I didn&rsquo;t quite get the
chance to special-order some kangaroo.  Since I&rsquo;m told meat pies are popular in Australia and the lamb was technically
from there, it still counts&hellip;  Right?</p>

<p><em>What?!  A food post that isn&rsquo;t themed?!</em>  That&rsquo;s right.  While the 52weeks deal resulted in consistency, doing only
those posts all the time got a bit stale, so I decided to go a bit off the beaten path.  This dish was inspired by what
is still one of the coolest videos I&rsquo;ve ever seen: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAekQ5fzfGM">Jacques Pepin deboning an entire chicken</a>.
A Galantine is a French (big surprise) technique where all of the bones are removed from a chicken, but the meat and
skin is kept intact like the remains of some sort of creepy skinwalker type transformation.   Everything is then
stuffed, rolled up, and roasted.</p>

<p>Despite its simplicity, it&rsquo;s one of the coolest techniques I have ever seen, and it makes carving much much easier
since you don&rsquo;t have any bones to contend with while grappling a hot chicken fresh out of the oven.  I&rsquo;ve only done this
a few times, and it&rsquo;s already become my de-facto method for preparing whole chicken&mdash;the cool factor, the corpse
desecration, the ease of plating&hellip;  What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve been to Anime Boston, or any other sort of nerdy/geeky gathering.  Maybe it was me drifting
away from the subculture and slowly becoming a filthy casual.  Maybe it was moving 40 miles &lt;&ndash; that way and not having a
car.  Or maybe it was the fact that they switched from nifty plastic convention badges to the slightly ghetto
paper-in-sleeve setup that they still had going this year.  For those who remember the cards&mdash;<em>yes, it&rsquo;s been that
long.</em></p>

<p>So when I was dropping by Copley this weekend to revisit some old watering holes and found out the convention was in
town, I figured why not?  I had some time to kill, and the registration lines looked pretty short.  I ended up only
staying the afternoon since my con-going stamina isn&rsquo;t what it used to be <em>(refer above to casual status)</em>, but here are
some quick impressions.</p>

<p>Garlic is such an ubiquitous ingredient that I could have easily <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2013/11/17/roast-leg-of-lamb/">cheated</a>
my way around this week&rsquo;s theme.  But where&rsquo;s the fun in that?  In the end, the decision came down to the deliciousness
of garlic bread and my curiosity for the concept of &ldquo;pull-apart bread&rdquo;, something that has been on the rise on
instagrammy/pinteresty/otherwise-artsy-craftsy sites lately.  The result was the above: some sort of garlic pull-apart
boule that&rsquo;s kind of a cross between your typical &ldquo;pull-apart bread&rdquo; and a hasselback potato.</p>

<p><em>Mind of a Chef</em> is not just great background noise for getting work done, it also pads out the list of cool and
unusual things I&rsquo;d like to try in the kitchen.  Out of all the things I&rsquo;d seen on the show, making gnocchi out of ramen
seemed among the most unusual and also among the simplest, so I decided it would be a prime target for this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;TV
Show Inspired&rdquo; theme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Normally I try to keep the &ldquo;dear diary&rdquo; factor on the blog low.  But in all the bustle of settling back into the east
coast with a new work arrangement, I all but forgot about the whole blogging thing until roughly 2 minutes ago.  So if
you&rsquo;re one of the ones who reads this for what little informational value I manage to provide, or are otherwise
uninterested in participating in this rare bout of masturbatory self-congratulations, here&rsquo;s your cue.</p>

<p>Still here?  So&hellip;  I got my blue belt in BJJ recently.  For anyone unfamiliar, it&rsquo;s basically the &ldquo;hurrah, you&rsquo;re no
longer a rookie&rdquo; rank, and in all seriousness this is one of my prouder moments.  Why?  Because of all my regular
activities, BJJ is the one where I have absolutely no talent whatsoever.  Seriously.  It took me a solid 2 years to get
to this point, and every day of that was spent with the mat being wiped by my face.  Ask anyone at the gym: I still get
rag-dolled on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Now, as a software developer (and all-around lazy nerd) I have a propensity to approach most problems by a) finding an
easier way to do it, b) deciding it&rsquo;s not worth the time, or c) see (a).  It&rsquo;s an approach that works for software, for
games, and probably for most challenges you&rsquo;re likely to find in the first world.  But it&rsquo;s great having proof that
sometimes you just have to show up and grind through and that&rsquo;s the only way to improve.  It&rsquo;s a reminder that
surprisingly often, the only actual obstacle is just you being a giant chicken and unwilling to leave your comfort zone.</p>

<p>So, as the kid who couldn&rsquo;t do a single push-up and ran a 13 minute mile in school, I&rsquo;d like to give myself a pat on the
back for managing to get this far.  And despite all the split lips, swollen fingers, and sprained joints, I sure hope I
get a lot farther in the future.</p>

<p>Oh, and&hellip;  I kind of lied about the lack of material.  I had another 52-weeks post lined up, but the experiment failed
horribly.  I&rsquo;m just buying time so I can do a second iteration and save SOME face, so&hellip;  Look forward to that one.</p>
