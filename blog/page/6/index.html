<p>Even though pork comes first in the post title, the focus here is really the cloud ears.  The presence of this &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;
fungus makes this post another one following the general theme of &ldquo;Suck it, General Tso&rdquo; in my collection of chinese
food writing.  But seriously, it tastes good.  Cloud ears (also known as wood ears) is very unique in its texture,
slightly slippery and crunchy at the same time.  Definitely something to try at least one, fungophobia or not.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-with-Cloud-Ears/i-hJ88hH5/0/L/DSC_0238-L.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud ears</li>
<li>Pork, preferably a fat part like belly</li>
<li>scallions</li>
<li>Chiles</li>
<li>Red Bell Pepper</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Ginger</li>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Rice wine</li>
<li>Corn starch or flour</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>


<p>Methodology</p>

<ol>
<li>Soak the cloud ears in hot water for about 15 minutes, until they are soft.</li>
<li>While they are soaking, slice the pork and place into a small bowl with some shaoxing wine, salt, and water,
thickening with a little bit of starch or flour.  Use about 2 parts water to 1 part shaoxing wine.  Mix well, and let
it sit.</li>
<li>Chop up the scallions (you can see in the above photo I&rsquo;ve cut it at an angle so it&rsquo;s more pleasing), and cut the
bell peppers and garlic into thin slices.  Cut the ginger into small thin strips.</li>
<li>When the cloud ears are ready, cut them into pieces of similar size to the pork slices.  Make sure to remove any
knobby hard bits from the pieces.</li>
<li>Heat your wok over high heat, then add some oil.  When it starts to just smoke, add the pork, and stir-fry it
quickly.  When the pieces are just starting to cook and turn white on the outside, add the ginger, garlic, chiles,
and red bell pepper.  Stir-fry until you can smell the ingredients strongly, about 20 &ndash; 30 seconds.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-with-Cloud-Ears/i-SdsD6Pz/0/M/DSC_0239-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Finally, add the scallions and cloud-ears, and season with more salt, and some ground pepper.  Add some stock (or
water), and thicken it with starch or flour to form a sauce.  Wait a bit more until the sauce has thickened, then
serve.</li>

<blockquote><p>And the yellow lighting strikes again!  This was my first attempt at composing a photo&mdash;Notice the fancy bowl and
towel in the background?  I&rsquo;ve stuck with a more plain-jane/straightforward approach since then, but who knows&hellip;  The
artsy side of me might make a comeback.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-v6hjqR6/0/L/DSC_0124-L.jpg"></p>

<p>I think tea eggs are just one of those foods that are iconic to the Chinese, but never really took off in the West as
opposed to foods that are &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; but never really found in China&hellip;  You know who you are.  There really is no
equivalent for this snack as far as I&rsquo;ve found, but it&rsquo;s one of the easiest to make and the most convenient for anyone
who needs something to chomp on the go.  Not to mention the soy sauce in combination with the tea and the anise shoot
the flavor (I believe it&rsquo;s commonly referred to as &ldquo;umami&rdquo; nowadays) of the egg up to absolutely unholy levels that
border on the addictive.</p>

<p>The name comes from the lovely marbling pattern that results from cracking the shells of the eggs to allow them to
absorb flavors while steeping, and the spice-infused &ldquo;tea&rdquo; that the eggs steep in.  The basic version that I was taught
as a child was tea, star anise, soy sauce, and sichuan peppercorns, also known most commonly as huajiao in Mandarin; but
honestly, this formula can be distilled to just tea, star anise, and soy sauce.  Other common ingredients I&rsquo;ve heard of
are cassia bark (an asian variety of cinnamon) and fennel seed.  I&rsquo;ve also seen people use Chinese fivespice powder in
replacement for all of the above; it&rsquo;s not something I like to do personally, but it doesn&rsquo;t turn out terribly.  The
best tea to use is some variety of black tea, usually pu erh or something similar.  I like using Lipton Orange Pekoe,
it&rsquo;s cheap and actually goes fairly well in this case; in fact, I keep a giant box around for just this purpose.  &hellip;
Well, this and bubble tea, but that&rsquo;s another day.</p>

<p>Regardless, the preparation for this is exceedingly simple, and requires barely more effort than hard-boiling some eggs.
In fact, the only part that can be construed as even remotely challenging is the cracking of the shells after boiling,
but even that can be done by schoolchildren.  Technically, that part can be skipped and the eggs can infuse as-is in the
tea liquid, but to anyone considering skipping it I&rsquo;d like to say&hellip;  Really?  Come on now.  Get your head out of your
ass.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 dozen eggs</li>
<li>&frac34; cup soy sauce</li>
<li>6 star anise</li>
<li>4 tea bags</li>
<li>Optional: cassia, sichuan peppercorns, fennel seed</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Cover eggs with water in a large pot and bring it to a boil. Remove the pot, put a lid on it, and let it rest for 20
minutes, then rinse the eggs and cover with cold water to cool.</li>
<li>Crack each egg gently by rapping on it with the back of a spoon.  Try to keep the shells in one piece, but have the
cracks still be visible; they should resemble something like a spiderweb.</li>
<li>Put the eggs along with the soy sauce, star anise, and the teabags (along with any of the optional flavorings) into a
pot.  Add water until the eggs are just covered.  Put a lid on the pot and simmer the eggs for about 1.5 &ndash; 2 hours.</li>
<li>Let the pot sit on the stove for about an hour, then put it in the fridge to steep overnight, preferably longer; I&rsquo;d
say somewhere around a day is ideal, but they&rsquo;re technically edible after about 8 hours.  You can skip the first
step, but be aware that putting an extremely warm pot in the fridge WILL cause a change on the overall temperature in
there, so if there is anything sensitive in there, don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>They can be kept in the fridge for up to a week in the tea liquid, two weeks if you&rsquo;re feeling daring.  Drained and
peeled, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;ll last a bit more than half a week.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>I swear I had a better picture showing a cross-section with the different layers of chocolate and plain batter, but I
guess not&hellip;  Another one for me to remember to update later, I guess.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-D2HdTsx/0/L/P1010107-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Chocolate marble cake was one of my first attempts at baking.  Or at least, one of the earliest successful (and
therefore not shameful and repressed) ones.  I don&rsquo;t make it too often now, as my tastes have migrated away from the
cake area for the moment, but it&rsquo;s simple, doesn&rsquo;t require much effort, and also has more butter than most people will
probably want.  While I have nothing against butter (I&rsquo;ll leave the rant against the modern day fat-crusade another
day), suffice to say&hellip;  If I brought this to a party, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody what I put in it.  Ever.</p>

<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s not nearly as heavy as the amount of butter would imply, though it&rsquo;s certainly not the lightest
dessert ever either.  It tastes just like it sounds like: a moderately rich cake, only slightly moist, with a strong
taste of chocolate that goes down exceptionally well with a cup of hot tea.  Personally, I like having a slice or two (a
la the photo above) with some whipped cream for breakfast on Sundays with a good mug of Jasmine Oolong.  But that&rsquo;s just
me.  One thing to keep in mind though is that this IS a butter cake.  That means it dries out very quickly, and it would
be best to keep it wrapped with a paper towel or somesuch (though not saran wrap, or it&rsquo;ll get soggy!), and microwave it
for about 10 seconds right before eating to revitalize it.  Do it, since warm and moist beats cold and dry any day with
this cake.</p>

<p>(Makes enough to roughly fill one standard medium loaf pan, about 4&#8221;x8&#8221;, I don&rsquo;t remember the exact dimensions.)</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>250g butter</li>
<li>430g sugar</li>
<li>5-6 large eggs</li>
<li>430g flour</li>
<li>10g baking powder</li>
<li>110g milk</li>
<li>30g cocoa powder</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Soften (or melt; in this case it doesn&rsquo;t matter) the butter, then mix with the sugar and the eggs.</li>
<li>Add the flour and then the milk, a bit at a time.</li>
<li>Put 1/3 of the batter into a separate container, and mix it with the cocoa powder.</li>
<li>Put the chocolate and the plain batters into their own pastry bags (or just cut holes into ziplocs if you&rsquo;re
lazy/strapped for materials).</li>
<li>Butter your loaf pan very thoroughly to protect against sticking.  This applies to non-stick pans as well; it just
makes life easier.</li>
<li>Pipe the batters, alternating plain and chocolate layers.  You may use whatever patterns you like, but the cocoa
powder in the chocolate batter should make it slightly heavier, and disturb the flat layers a bit while baking
regardless of what you do.</li>
<li>This is purely my opinion, but it&rsquo;s preferable to finish with a layer of plain batter on top.</li>
<li>Bake at 320 degrees Fahrenheit, for about 1hr 15min.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>This is a super weird one with tiny tiny photos, but a still quality post on a somewhat-obscure topic, so I&rsquo;m

<p>It was originally written by my then-roommate <a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a> who had translated it from a French
blog.  So it&rsquo;s me backporting a post by him which he ported from someone else.  Yep.  The below is verbatim; I only

<h3>About</h3>

<p>The Canelés are small French cakes which used to be consumed in the city of Bordeaux during the 17th century. You will
find different ways to spell its name such as: Cannelé, Cannelet, Canelet&hellip; but the modern spelling is indeed Canelé.</p>

<p>This recipe was written by Bernard, who kindly accepted I translate it into English. Here is the link to his blog (in
French): <a href="http://lesrecettesdebernard.blogspot.com/2010/01/voila-mes-declicieux-caneles-ils-vont.html">Bernard&rsquo;s Recipes</a>. He has a
fantastic food blog with a million great recipes. You will find his helpful comments in <em>italic</em> and my comments in
<strong>bold</strong>.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>This recipe requires a 24h resting time, as well as specific molds. Your oven must be able to reach 250C (480F)
otherwise it will not work.  Ingredients</p>

<h3>Ingredients are for 22 large canelés:</h3>

<ul>
<li>1L whole milk</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>4 egg yolks</li>
<li>280g flour</li>
<li>475g sugar</li>
<li>50g unsalted butter</li>
<li>10cL dark rum (how to pick rum)</li>
<li>2 table spoons, liquid vanilla extract (how to pick vanilla)</li>
<li>2 vanilla beans (how to pick vanilla)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Special equipment</h3>

<ul>
<li>10 to 22 metallic canelé molds (we like aluminum with a black Teflon coating, copper is ok but requires a much warmer oven)</li>
<li>non-stick cooking spray (we like Wilton&rsquo;s Cake Release)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Recipe</h3>

<ol>
<li>Boil together the milk, butter, rum, vanilla extract and the vanilla beans cut on their length.</li>
<li>When it starts simmering, cut the heat and let it infuse 15 minutes on the stove.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks and sugar together until you get a pale colored mix with a few bubbles.
<strong>This might take you a few minutes of mixing.</strong></li>
<li>Once the vanilla is done infusing in the pot, take out the beans and scrape their seeds out with your thumb and place
the seeds in the mixing bowl with the eggs. Put the emptied beans back into the pot.</li>
<li>Turn the heat on again until the milk simmers again. Once it does, cut the heat and let it cool down for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour about 1/5 of the hot milk into the eggs. Mix thoroughly and add all the flour. Mix again and add the remainder
of the hot milk. <em>It is important to pour the milk while its very hot (not boiling though) to allow the eggs to cook
slightly.</em></li>
<li>Rest the batter for 24h at room temperature. <strong>This step is absolutely necessary! otherwise it will just not work.</strong></li>
<li>The next day, make sure you mix the batter properly for 2 minutes to make sure the butter reintegrates in the batter.
You will also notice the foam on top will disappear.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Other/Ch-backport-other/i-9VvjkNH/0/O/photo-22-300x224.jpg"></li>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to 275C (or 530F). Your oven must reach at least 250C (480F) in order for the recipe to work. <em>The
baking is done in 2 steps. The first step is at a high temperature that solidifies the batter in the molds. The
second step at a low temperature cooks the batter through the center. Do not use silicone molds! they can&rsquo;t withstand
the first baking phase and since they are not made of metal, they do not conduct heat properly. Use aluminum or
copper molds, we like Teflon coated aluminum molds.</em></li>
<li>Now take your molds and spray them up with a non-stick food spray. <em>Forget about butter here, it is completely useless
and actually makes it worse when it comes to removing your canelés from the molds. Also, make sure your molds are
perfectly clean! any tiny piece of older canelés could make a canelé impossible to get out of the mold.</em></li>
<li>Fill the molds with batter up to 1mm off the edge. <em>Some recipes recommend to leave up to a centimeter, but its
wrong! after baking, the canelé is as high as the batter was in the mold.</em>
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Other/Ch-backport-other/i-pGJXzr3/0/O/photo-32-300x224.jpg"></li>
<li>Place in the oven at mid height at 275C (530F) for 15 minutes. Then without stopping the oven, lower the temperature
to 200C (390F) for 35 minutes. <em>Every oven is different so it might take a few attempts before you can find your right
timings.</em> <strong>I advise putting 4 canelés in the oven at first, as a first attempt. It usually takes me one bad attempt to
figure out the right timings when I use a new oven.</strong></li>
<li>Take the canelés out of the oven and let them cool down on a grid, then take them out of the molds. <em>You should eat
the canelés several hours after they cool down, as the core is still cooking after it&rsquo;s out of the oven. The inside
needs to set.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>This interesting little cake isn&rsquo;t really a cake in the classical sense. It&rsquo;s more like a bunch of crepes stacked
together with filling. But it can be made easily with relatively little hassle and frustration, and yields a pretty
awesome result for a great output:effort ratio. So without further ado&hellip;  Ingredients</p>

<p>(For the crepes, makes about 10 crepes of diameter ~9 in)</p>

<ul>
<li>280g flour</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>100g sugar</li>
<li>450ml milk</li>
<li>50 ml rum</li>
</ul>


<p>(Cream filling part 1; pastry cream)</p>

<ul>
<li>500ml milk</li>
<li>20g butter</li>
<li>100g sugar</li>
<li>100g egg yolk (about 6-7 yolks from large eggs)</li>
<li>50g flour</li>
</ul>


<p>(Cream filling part 2, whipped cream with gelatin)</p>

<ul>
<li>400ml heavy cream</li>
<li>30g sugar</li>
<li>6g gelatin</li>
</ul>


<p>Methodology</p>

<ol>
<li>The first and obvious thing to do is to make the crepes. But that is outside the scope of this post (read: Thomas is
being a prat and wants to write about crepes), so I&rsquo;ll just leave the ingredients up. Anyway, after they&rsquo;re finish
stick &lsquo;em in the refrigerator to cool down.</li>
<li>Part 1 of the filling is essentially a standard pastry cream. We need to make this first so it can cool down to room
temp. So first mix all the egg yolks along with about &frac34; of the sugar in a large bowl, until the mixture is very
smooth. Sift the flour into it, and beat it some more until it&rsquo;s smooth and lumpless again.</li>
<li>Put the milk, butter, and remaining sugar into a saucepot, and bring it to a boil. Just be careful not to burn it.</li>
<li>Once it&rsquo;s boiling, pour half of the milk mixture into the egg mixture, and stir it together. Pour only half so that
the egg yolks don&rsquo;t end up cooked. Then, pour this new mixture into the saucepot with the remaining milk, and put it
back on the stove; again, be careful and monitor the heat, or things will burn/cook too fast.</li>
<li>Take a spoon and stir while heating up the pot. You will know the pastry cream is ready when it starts thickening up
(this is because of the yolks cooking). Another big sign is that it will start bubbling; huge big bubbles popping
everywhere. Much like if you threw a drop of water into a pan full of really hot oil, except not as messy (or
unpleasant).</li>
<li>Now we need for it to cool to room temp. The best way is to put it someplace with a large surface area; what I like
to do is use a refrigerated baking sheet covered with parchment paper. While we wait, prepare part 2 of the filling.</li>
<li>Part 2 of the filling is a simple whipped cream. Again uttering a prayer for the poor souls who have to do this by
hand, whisk the cream into soft peaks, dump in the sugar, and then whisk to hard peaks.</li>
<li>You thought I forgot about the gelatin, didn&rsquo;t you. I did not. You probably still have a few minutes left before the
pastry cream cools, so bloom your gelatin now. How it works will depend on what type of gelatin, but generally
speaking following the directions on the package is not a bad idea.  Usually though, blooming just involves letting
it sit in cold water for about 5 minutes, then draining it, then microwaving a few seconds to melt it the rest of the
way.  Just make sure the gelatin&rsquo;s actually melted, since none of our ingredients will be hot enough to actually melt
the gelatin.</li>
<li>When the pastry cream is at room temp, toss the gelatin in there. Then fold the whipped cream in, 1/3 at a time to
minimize deflating it.</li>
<li>And now you have both components of the cake. Simply stack crepes together with filling in between, then put the
final result in the fridge for a few hours to set, and you have a mille crepe. Dust it with some powdered sugar, top
it with toasted almonds, whatever works, and put it in the fridge.  I recommend at least 6 hours to let it set;
otherwise, the layers will just fall apart, since the cream will fail to hold them together.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The instructions might be a formidable wall of text, but it&rsquo;s really not as hard as it seems; in fact, this is
probably a relatively easy and workless dessert to make.</li>
<li>In the photo I just added sliced strawberries to the filling, but other good ones to try are banana, mango, pineapple,
mango, and kiwi.</li>
<li>You can also flavor the filling with a tablespoon or two of rum for an extra bit of flair.</li>
<li>Something I haven&rsquo;t tried is to marinate the fruits in liquor (like rum or grand marnier) or to macerate them with
sugar, but it sounds like a good idea. Just saying now that I haven&rsquo;t tried it personally though.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<blockquote><p>Ah yes, the time I took all pictures off an android phone with really crappy low-light performance&hellip;  I&rsquo;m feeling all
nostalgic just looking at this.  Check out dat ISO.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-hR5rp9z/0/L/IMAG0113-L.jpg"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again, folks. That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m playing with another Keller recipe. This time, it started
when I saw a few slices of pork belly over at HMart, and for some reason I immediately thought of Keller&rsquo;s pork belly
confit recipe in Ad Hoc At Home so I went and bought it. Well, as it turns out I don&rsquo;t have nearly enough duck fat or
lard to do a proper confit, so I decided to follow his braised pork belly recipe instead.</p>

<p>Keller does give quantities to his ingredients, but&hellip; I will not be providing them here. It is not because of some
stupid Intellectual Property thing (recipes fortunately are pretty much free game), but I respect him both as a chef and
as a cookbook writer, and I think you should buy his book&hellip; Here is an amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ad-Hoc-Home-Thomas-Keller/dp/1579653774">link</a>. (See, no affiliate code, so Amazon
isn&rsquo;t paying me for your clicks. Just saying.)</p>

<p>Anyhow, let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Basil</li>
<li>Thyme</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Rosemary</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Bay leaves</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Peppercorns</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Pork Belly, with skin removed</li>
<li>Beef Stock</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Throw everything but the beef stock and the pork belly into a big pot of water, big enough to hold everything at
once. Bring the mixture to a boil, and boil for one minute. Afterwards, let it cool down and chill in the fridge.
This brine can be kept for up to 3 days in the fridge after initial preparation.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-59QXP2G/0/L/IMAG0086-L.jpg">
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-GR2ZJpf/0/L/IMAG0087-L.jpg"></li>
<li>Put the pork into the brine. Let it rest in the fridge for 10 hours; Keller recommends no more, or the pork will get
over-salty.</li>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to 320 degrees F. While it&rsquo;s warming up, put the pork into an oven-safe saute pan fat-side down
and cook it on medium-low heat, until the fat is a beautiful golden brown and nicely rendered, about 15 &ndash; 20 minutes.
Be sure to get rid of the excess fat that gets rendered out.</li>
<li>Put enough of the beef stock into the pan to come about &frac12; up the side of the pork, then cover the pan with a
parchment lid (basically a circular sheet of parchment with a hole in the middle, big enough to cover your pan) and
put it into the oven.. Let the pork cook until tender, about 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>After it&rsquo;s done cooking take it out to let it cool down, then put the pork and the liquid into a tray, and cover with
plastic wrap. Place a smaller tray on top, and weigh it down with something heavy like a can or a bottle; I used a
jar of honey and citron:<br/>
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-R5f4kc9/0/L/IMAG0089-L.jpg">
The purpose of this is to compress the layers of the pork and give it a better texture at the end. I personally
tested this by leaving one of my pieces of pork un-compressed, and it does make a noticeable difference. Let this
rest in the fridge like this for 12 hours.</li>
<li>The pork can be stored like this in its liquid for 3 days. To serve though, pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees
fahrenheit. Remove any fat that may have solidified in your braising liquid, then put the pork fat side down again
into the pan, with enough liquid to come up &frac14; inch of the side of the meat. Bring the stock to a simmer and baste
it with the liquid.</li>
<li>Transfer the meat to the oven and cook, basting a few times, for about 15 minutes. Then flip the meat over so it&rsquo;s
fat side up, and cook for another 5 minutes, keeping up the continual basting so the meat becomes glazed and a nice
rich brown color.</li>
<li>Reduce the remaining braising liquid in a pan to a thicker sauce-like consistency, and serve it with the belly. I
decided to cut mine into little chunks, and here is the result:</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The first and foremost note here is that pork belly is delicious, but EXTREMELY rich. In fact, there is nearly a 1:1
lean meat:fat ratio. As such&hellip; It is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED to eat the amount shown in the picture in one sitting.
The plate that was in the picture was shared between myself and two others, and lasted roughly 2.5 meals served with
rice and another side dish.</li>
<li>Yes, it was delicious.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Another old post, verbatim, by <a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a>.  Sorry for the lack of picture, I swear I&rsquo;ll remember
to take one next time I make this&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Chocolate Soufflé is both one of the toughest and most delicious desserts ever invented, but hopefully if you follow
this guide closely you should get a decent result.  Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>170g of baking chocolate</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>100g of sugar</li>
<li>1 coffee spoon of corn starch</li>
<li>1 coffee spoon of cocoa powder</li>
<li>200mL of heavy cream</li>
<li>Unsalted butter</li>
</ul>


<h3>Special Equipment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sauce pot (smallest pot possible)</li>
<li>Sieve</li>
<li>4 to 8 oven resistant glass/cermic cups</li>
</ul>


<h3>Recipe</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start by cutting the baking chocolate into small pieces (bigger than powder but smaller than pebbles), the size
doesnt really matter as long as its small.</li>
<li>Now place your sauce pot on the stove turn the heat to the lowest possible. Add the cream and using a sieve, add the
cocoa powder and the corn starch. Even though this amount looks ridiculously small and might not even cover the
bottom of the pot, don&rsquo;t worry.</li>
<li>Wait until either bubbles appear or that the cocoa powder is obviously melted. Whisk the mixture and when done, turn
off the heat and add the chocolate you cut in pieces.</li>
<li>Then separate the yolks from the egg whites and mix the yolks with the chocolate mixture (keep the white in a bowl).</li>
<li>After whisking for some time you should obtain a smooth result.</li>
<li>Now whisk the egg whites until they form a snowy result. As you beat the whites, add the sugar step by step, a small
amount at a time. When the whites stick to the bottom of the bowl, it means its ready. Be careful, as sugar is mixed,
you won&rsquo;t be able to achieve the same hardness as usually when beating egg whites, don&rsquo;t be surprised.</li>
<li>Pour the chocolate mix in a bigger bowl. Now comes the most delicate part of the process (forget about the electric
beater), take a big spoon and add some egg whites to the chocolate. Don&rsquo;t mix! simply try to move it around slow
until it becomes incorporated in the chocolate. Do this again until all the whites are in the chocolate and it looks
uniform.</li>
<li>This is all for now! pour the resulting batter in small oven resistant cups and place them in the fridge until you
decide to serve, if you feel like eating it right away, then don&rsquo;t wait and keep reading.</li>
</ol>


<h3>When ready to serve</h3>

<ul>
<li>Preheat your oven to 355F (180C).</li>
<li>Place your cups in the oven for 10 to 15 mins (could take up to 20 mins). You know they are ready when you see them
blowing and rising out of their cups.</li>
<li>The chocolate soufflé should have a thin crust on the outside, have a light air filled inside with bubbles and the
core may be more or less liquid, depending on how you like it.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<blockquote><p>This one holds a special place in my heart for being the first food post I ever wrote.  Tiramisu was really the first
thing that introduced me to the world of pastry, I really have my old roommate <a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a> to
thank for that.  Well, that and indirectly the entire subsequent hobby&hellip;  And probably the associated weight gain
too.</p>

<p>2009 isn&rsquo;t that long ago (2014 at the time of this comment), but it feels like ages already.  And in classic college
sophomore form, I&rsquo;m so pretentious here it hurts&hellip;  But in the interest of honesty I&rsquo;ll leave the post as-is, I
suppose.  Might update with better pictures though&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Since this is the first post with actual content in it (thereby making it the real first post), why not start off with a
bang?  Today&rsquo;s topic is&hellip;  Tiramisu.  Just for a little background&hellip;  Tiramisu is an Italian type of dessert; I&rsquo;d
probably class it as a cake.  (Yes, I know &lsquo;tiramisu&rsquo; sounds Japanese; no, it&rsquo;s Italian; yes, I&rsquo;m sure.)  But this
particular dessert has been so popular over the years that it has been adapted into cakes, puddings, and various other
forms; I find that not nearly enough people know about it in its original form anymore.  In fact, a quick google
revealed the most obscene recipes I could possibly imagine.  Only when I hit Italian Google (yeah, that&rsquo;s right) and
consulted with a European or two that I found the true classical recipe.  So without further ado&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lots of savoiardi, also known as ladyfingers</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>125g sugar (approx .63 cup)</li>
<li>400g mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>Powdered cocoa (to be sprinkled on top)</li>
<li>2 cups coffee, large</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>Bit of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<p>(The above makes enough to fill two 8inx13in glass trays.)</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>What you want to do is to get two bowls and separate the egg whites from the egg yolks.  The important part here is
to not get any yolk in the white.  Having a bit of white with your yolks is okay; obviously you don&rsquo;t want too much,
but you get the idea.</li>
<li>Next, add all your sugar and however much vanilla extract into the egg yolks and start mixing it until you get a
nice, creamy mixture.  The thing to look for here is that 1) it&rsquo;s nice and smooth, and 2) it should actually be a
slightly paler yellow than the egg yolks originally were.</li>
<li>Add the mascarpone cheese into the egg yolk-sugar mixture.  Start whisking again, until you get a homogeneous mixture
with no lumps of mascarpone in it.  Try to get it as smooth as possible.  Note:  You don&rsquo;t need exactly 400g; just
somewhere around.  Personally, I end up adding something closer to 450 most of the time anyway&hellip;  Since this doesn&rsquo;t
demand extreme precision in ingredient amount, it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s take a little break from the whisking.  Get your savoiardi and coffee out; I recommend having the coffee ready
and cooled down to at least luke-warm, since more likely than not you will end up touching it.  What you want to do
now is put the coffee in a tray or in a plate or something.  Next, dip the savoiardi into the coffee.  The key here
is that you want to soak them, but not thoroughly.  Essentially, when you dip the savoiardi the coffee will get
absorbed upwards.  When it&rsquo;s about halfway up (err on the side of more here; the only thing worse than too wet  is
too dry), take it out and lay it in the tray as shown.  The reason behind the way you soak it is that when it&rsquo;s
resting in the fridge later, capillary action will bring the coffee up further into the ladyfinger.  Not to mention
it&rsquo;ll absorb the moisture from the mascarpone filling; so it&rsquo;s all good.  And these little suckers hold a LOT more
coffee than you&rsquo;d think; we used two Large coffees from Starbucks (plain coffee, 2 bucks apiece) to soak two trays&#8217;
worth of savoiardi properly.</li>
<li>Now it&rsquo;s back to the whisk.  Here&rsquo;s the part where people either have an electric beater, or really really wish they
did.  And if there isn&rsquo;t even a whisk available&hellip;  Give up.  Right now.  Seriously.  You will hurt yourself.
Otherwise&hellip;  Toss in a pinch of salt and whisk/beat/whatever the egg whites.  They will go from transparent to
foamy, and foamy to REALLY foamy; what you&rsquo;re looking for is what chefs call a &ldquo;stiff white peak&rdquo;; if you pick some
up with your whisk/beater and you see that the egg white hangs on in a stiff manner, then it&rsquo;s ready.  (Why did we
not do this before soaking the savoiardi? Because after you whip them they start collapsing. REALLY FAST. So you&rsquo;d
have had to do it again. You don&rsquo;t want that.)</li>
<li>Slowly fold the mascarpone mixture into the egg whites.  And by slowly I mean about a spatulaful at a time.  It&rsquo;s a
VERY bad idea to plop it all in at once since that might destroy the whites and make them collapse.  And trust me,
nobody wants to hand-whisk more than one batch of egg whites at once.</li>
<li>Spread the mixture evenly across your trays of savoiardi, and then stick it in the fridge for 6-24 hours.  Ta-da!</li>
<li>When you want to serve it, sprinkle some cocoa powder on top.  You do this right before you serve since if it&rsquo;s done
beforehand, the cocoa powder will absorb moisture from the filling, and turn out a bit soggy.  It&rsquo;s not a big deal,
but hey.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can make multi-layer tiramisu with a big enough tray.  Each layer should be, from bottom to top:  savoiardi, filling, cocoa powder.  Then on the very top you can throw some chocolate or whatever if you feel like.</li>
<li>It turns out home-made savoiardi are way better than the packaged sort.  And the method behind them is amazingly simple, and the stuff is dead useful; however, I discovered this after my pilot journey with the tiramisu, so I used the packaged stuff.  The stuff is awesome though (kind of like a firmer spongecake) so I will be sure to post about it later.</li>
<li>Yes, traditionally tiramisu is made with espresso; however, espresso is just super-concentrated coffee.  I personally don&rsquo;t mind either way, but purists will insist, I suppose&hellip;</li>
