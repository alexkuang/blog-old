<blockquote><p>Ah yes, the time I took all pictures off an android phone with really crappy low-light performance&hellip;  I&rsquo;m feeling all
nostalgic just looking at this.  Check out dat ISO.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-hR5rp9z/0/L/IMAG0113-L.jpg"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again, folks. That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m playing with another Keller recipe. This time, it started
when I saw a few slices of pork belly over at HMart, and for some reason I immediately thought of Keller&rsquo;s pork belly
confit recipe in Ad Hoc At Home so I went and bought it. Well, as it turns out I don&rsquo;t have nearly enough duck fat or
lard to do a proper confit, so I decided to follow his braised pork belly recipe instead.</p>

<p>Keller does give quantities to his ingredients, but&hellip; I will not be providing them here. It is not because of some
stupid Intellectual Property thing (recipes fortunately are pretty much free game), but I respect him both as a chef and
as a cookbook writer, and I think you should buy his book&hellip; Here is an amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ad-Hoc-Home-Thomas-Keller/dp/1579653774">link</a>. (See, no affiliate code, so Amazon
isn&rsquo;t paying me for your clicks. Just saying.)</p>

<p>Anyhow, let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Basil</li>
<li>Thyme</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Rosemary</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Bay leaves</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Peppercorns</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Pork Belly, with skin removed</li>
<li>Beef Stock</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Throw everything but the beef stock and the pork belly into a big pot of water, big enough to hold everything at
once. Bring the mixture to a boil, and boil for one minute. Afterwards, let it cool down and chill in the fridge.
This brine can be kept for up to 3 days in the fridge after initial preparation.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-59QXP2G/0/L/IMAG0086-L.jpg">
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-GR2ZJpf/0/L/IMAG0087-L.jpg"></li>
<li>Put the pork into the brine. Let it rest in the fridge for 10 hours; Keller recommends no more, or the pork will get
over-salty.</li>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to 320 degrees F. While it&rsquo;s warming up, put the pork into an oven-safe saute pan fat-side down
and cook it on medium-low heat, until the fat is a beautiful golden brown and nicely rendered, about 15 &ndash; 20 minutes.
Be sure to get rid of the excess fat that gets rendered out.</li>
<li>Put enough of the beef stock into the pan to come about &frac12; up the side of the pork, then cover the pan with a
parchment lid (basically a circular sheet of parchment with a hole in the middle, big enough to cover your pan) and
put it into the oven.. Let the pork cook until tender, about 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>After it&rsquo;s done cooking take it out to let it cool down, then put the pork and the liquid into a tray, and cover with
plastic wrap. Place a smaller tray on top, and weigh it down with something heavy like a can or a bottle; I used a
jar of honey and citron:<br/>
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Braised-Pork-Belly/i-R5f4kc9/0/L/IMAG0089-L.jpg">
The purpose of this is to compress the layers of the pork and give it a better texture at the end. I personally
tested this by leaving one of my pieces of pork un-compressed, and it does make a noticeable difference. Let this
rest in the fridge like this for 12 hours.</li>
<li>The pork can be stored like this in its liquid for 3 days. To serve though, pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees
fahrenheit. Remove any fat that may have solidified in your braising liquid, then put the pork fat side down again
into the pan, with enough liquid to come up &frac14; inch of the side of the meat. Bring the stock to a simmer and baste
it with the liquid.</li>
<li>Transfer the meat to the oven and cook, basting a few times, for about 15 minutes. Then flip the meat over so it&rsquo;s
fat side up, and cook for another 5 minutes, keeping up the continual basting so the meat becomes glazed and a nice
rich brown color.</li>
<li>Reduce the remaining braising liquid in a pan to a thicker sauce-like consistency, and serve it with the belly. I
decided to cut mine into little chunks, and here is the result:</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The first and foremost note here is that pork belly is delicious, but EXTREMELY rich. In fact, there is nearly a 1:1
lean meat:fat ratio. As such&hellip; It is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED to eat the amount shown in the picture in one sitting.
The plate that was in the picture was shared between myself and two others, and lasted roughly 2.5 meals served with
rice and another side dish.</li>
<li>Yes, it was delicious.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Another old post, verbatim, by <a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a>.  Sorry for the lack of picture, I swear I&rsquo;ll remember
to take one next time I make this&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Chocolate Soufflé is both one of the toughest and most delicious desserts ever invented, but hopefully if you follow
this guide closely you should get a decent result.  Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>170g of baking chocolate</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>100g of sugar</li>
<li>1 coffee spoon of corn starch</li>
<li>1 coffee spoon of cocoa powder</li>
<li>200mL of heavy cream</li>
<li>Unsalted butter</li>
</ul>


<h3>Special Equipment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sauce pot (smallest pot possible)</li>
<li>Sieve</li>
<li>4 to 8 oven resistant glass/cermic cups</li>
</ul>


<h3>Recipe</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start by cutting the baking chocolate into small pieces (bigger than powder but smaller than pebbles), the size
doesnt really matter as long as its small.</li>
<li>Now place your sauce pot on the stove turn the heat to the lowest possible. Add the cream and using a sieve, add the
cocoa powder and the corn starch. Even though this amount looks ridiculously small and might not even cover the
bottom of the pot, don&rsquo;t worry.</li>
<li>Wait until either bubbles appear or that the cocoa powder is obviously melted. Whisk the mixture and when done, turn
off the heat and add the chocolate you cut in pieces.</li>
<li>Then separate the yolks from the egg whites and mix the yolks with the chocolate mixture (keep the white in a bowl).</li>
<li>After whisking for some time you should obtain a smooth result.</li>
<li>Now whisk the egg whites until they form a snowy result. As you beat the whites, add the sugar step by step, a small
amount at a time. When the whites stick to the bottom of the bowl, it means its ready. Be careful, as sugar is mixed,
you won&rsquo;t be able to achieve the same hardness as usually when beating egg whites, don&rsquo;t be surprised.</li>
<li>Pour the chocolate mix in a bigger bowl. Now comes the most delicate part of the process (forget about the electric
beater), take a big spoon and add some egg whites to the chocolate. Don&rsquo;t mix! simply try to move it around slow
until it becomes incorporated in the chocolate. Do this again until all the whites are in the chocolate and it looks
uniform.</li>
<li>This is all for now! pour the resulting batter in small oven resistant cups and place them in the fridge until you
decide to serve, if you feel like eating it right away, then don&rsquo;t wait and keep reading.</li>
</ol>


<h3>When ready to serve</h3>

<ul>
<li>Preheat your oven to 355F (180C).</li>
<li>Place your cups in the oven for 10 to 15 mins (could take up to 20 mins). You know they are ready when you see them
blowing and rising out of their cups.</li>
<li>The chocolate soufflé should have a thin crust on the outside, have a light air filled inside with bubbles and the
core may be more or less liquid, depending on how you like it.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<blockquote><p>This one holds a special place in my heart for being the first food post I ever wrote.  Tiramisu was really the first
thing that introduced me to the world of pastry, I really have my old roommate <a href="http://tlextrait.com/">Thomas</a> to
thank for that.  Well, that and indirectly the entire subsequent hobby&hellip;  And probably the associated weight gain
too.</p>

<p>2009 isn&rsquo;t that long ago (2014 at the time of this comment), but it feels like ages already.  And in classic college
sophomore form, I&rsquo;m so pretentious here it hurts&hellip;  But in the interest of honesty I&rsquo;ll leave the post as-is, I
suppose.  Might update with better pictures though&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Since this is the first post with actual content in it (thereby making it the real first post), why not start off with a
bang?  Today&rsquo;s topic is&hellip;  Tiramisu.  Just for a little background&hellip;  Tiramisu is an Italian type of dessert; I&rsquo;d
probably class it as a cake.  (Yes, I know &lsquo;tiramisu&rsquo; sounds Japanese; no, it&rsquo;s Italian; yes, I&rsquo;m sure.)  But this
particular dessert has been so popular over the years that it has been adapted into cakes, puddings, and various other
forms; I find that not nearly enough people know about it in its original form anymore.  In fact, a quick google
revealed the most obscene recipes I could possibly imagine.  Only when I hit Italian Google (yeah, that&rsquo;s right) and
consulted with a European or two that I found the true classical recipe.  So without further ado&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lots of savoiardi, also known as ladyfingers</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>125g sugar (approx .63 cup)</li>
<li>400g mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>Powdered cocoa (to be sprinkled on top)</li>
<li>2 cups coffee, large</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>Bit of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<p>(The above makes enough to fill two 8inx13in glass trays.)</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>What you want to do is to get two bowls and separate the egg whites from the egg yolks.  The important part here is
to not get any yolk in the white.  Having a bit of white with your yolks is okay; obviously you don&rsquo;t want too much,
but you get the idea.</li>
<li>Next, add all your sugar and however much vanilla extract into the egg yolks and start mixing it until you get a
nice, creamy mixture.  The thing to look for here is that 1) it&rsquo;s nice and smooth, and 2) it should actually be a
slightly paler yellow than the egg yolks originally were.</li>
<li>Add the mascarpone cheese into the egg yolk-sugar mixture.  Start whisking again, until you get a homogeneous mixture
with no lumps of mascarpone in it.  Try to get it as smooth as possible.  Note:  You don&rsquo;t need exactly 400g; just
somewhere around.  Personally, I end up adding something closer to 450 most of the time anyway&hellip;  Since this doesn&rsquo;t
demand extreme precision in ingredient amount, it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s take a little break from the whisking.  Get your savoiardi and coffee out; I recommend having the coffee ready
and cooled down to at least luke-warm, since more likely than not you will end up touching it.  What you want to do
now is put the coffee in a tray or in a plate or something.  Next, dip the savoiardi into the coffee.  The key here
is that you want to soak them, but not thoroughly.  Essentially, when you dip the savoiardi the coffee will get
absorbed upwards.  When it&rsquo;s about halfway up (err on the side of more here; the only thing worse than too wet  is
too dry), take it out and lay it in the tray as shown.  The reason behind the way you soak it is that when it&rsquo;s
resting in the fridge later, capillary action will bring the coffee up further into the ladyfinger.  Not to mention
it&rsquo;ll absorb the moisture from the mascarpone filling; so it&rsquo;s all good.  And these little suckers hold a LOT more
coffee than you&rsquo;d think; we used two Large coffees from Starbucks (plain coffee, 2 bucks apiece) to soak two trays&#8217;
worth of savoiardi properly.</li>
<li>Now it&rsquo;s back to the whisk.  Here&rsquo;s the part where people either have an electric beater, or really really wish they
did.  And if there isn&rsquo;t even a whisk available&hellip;  Give up.  Right now.  Seriously.  You will hurt yourself.
Otherwise&hellip;  Toss in a pinch of salt and whisk/beat/whatever the egg whites.  They will go from transparent to
foamy, and foamy to REALLY foamy; what you&rsquo;re looking for is what chefs call a &ldquo;stiff white peak&rdquo;; if you pick some
up with your whisk/beater and you see that the egg white hangs on in a stiff manner, then it&rsquo;s ready.  (Why did we
not do this before soaking the savoiardi? Because after you whip them they start collapsing. REALLY FAST. So you&rsquo;d
have had to do it again. You don&rsquo;t want that.)</li>
<li>Slowly fold the mascarpone mixture into the egg whites.  And by slowly I mean about a spatulaful at a time.  It&rsquo;s a
VERY bad idea to plop it all in at once since that might destroy the whites and make them collapse.  And trust me,
nobody wants to hand-whisk more than one batch of egg whites at once.</li>
<li>Spread the mixture evenly across your trays of savoiardi, and then stick it in the fridge for 6-24 hours.  Ta-da!</li>
<li>When you want to serve it, sprinkle some cocoa powder on top.  You do this right before you serve since if it&rsquo;s done
beforehand, the cocoa powder will absorb moisture from the filling, and turn out a bit soggy.  It&rsquo;s not a big deal,
but hey.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can make multi-layer tiramisu with a big enough tray.  Each layer should be, from bottom to top:  savoiardi, filling, cocoa powder.  Then on the very top you can throw some chocolate or whatever if you feel like.</li>
<li>It turns out home-made savoiardi are way better than the packaged sort.  And the method behind them is amazingly simple, and the stuff is dead useful; however, I discovered this after my pilot journey with the tiramisu, so I used the packaged stuff.  The stuff is awesome though (kind of like a firmer spongecake) so I will be sure to post about it later.</li>
<li>Yes, traditionally tiramisu is made with espresso; however, espresso is just super-concentrated coffee.  I personally don&rsquo;t mind either way, but purists will insist, I suppose&hellip;</li>
