<p>The few times I&rsquo;ve used vanilla have always been for dessert, so for this week&rsquo;s challenge I really wanted to try
something savory.  Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything that didn&rsquo;t sound horrifying even in my head, so I ended
up going with a dessert anyway; tough nuts.  To be fair though, I stuck with the spirit of leaving my comfort zone and
made multiple things I&rsquo;ve never done before&mdash;panna cotta and apple compote.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Since this was my first attempt, I feel like everything could still use some fine-tuning, but overall the results were
acceptable (more on that below), so I&rsquo;ll jot down the quantities and everything just for reference.</p>

<h2>Apples</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 braeburn apples</li>
<li>200g sugar</li>
<li>8g pectin</li>
<li>1 vanilla bean</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>A quick note on pectin:</strong>  Pectin comes in many forms.  The top differentiator is high or low methoxy
pectin, which dictates what kind of environment the pectin needs to set.  Generally speaking, unless you&rsquo;re shopping at
the modernist pantry, high-methoxy pectin is what you&rsquo;ll be getting.  HM pectin sets in an acidic environment, which is
why most of the time it&rsquo;s already cut with a little bit of citric acid when sold.  This is perfectly fine.  Of course, HM
pectin is itself differentiated by how fast it sets: Rapid set, medium set, and so on.  In this case, it shouldn&rsquo;t
matter too much, as any common consumer pectin that&rsquo;s labeled as suitable for jam should be around the right range, but
it&rsquo;s still worth noting since the variation in citric acid + pectin type is what accounts for some brands of pectin not
working with some types of fruit.</p>

<p>The first part is fairly easy.  Dice up the apples into small &frac12; inch chunks (for the more particular among us, I ended
up with roughly 240g apple).  Combine it with the sugar, pectin, and vanilla bean, and put everything on low heat.  The
sugar should start melting fairly quickly, and the apples will start bubbling as they cook, like so:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Panna-Cotta-with-Apple/i-nrDwR7n/0/L/DSC_2395-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Keep the apples on low heat until they are completely cooked through and translucent; this should take about 45 minutes.
In the above photo, a few of the chunks in the center and to the left are starting to get there.  Be careful not to burn
anything, and give the pot a stir every once in a while.</p>

<p>After the cooking, they should basically look like jelly.  At this point, the seeds from the spent vanilla pod can be
scraped out and combined with the apples, but that&rsquo;s optional.  Stick everything in a ball jar (or other container of
choice) and chill in the fridge.</p>

<h2>Panna Cotta</h2>

<ul>
<li>600ml cream</li>
<li>3 sheets of gelatin (~5g)</li>
<li>50g sugar</li>
<li>1 vanilla bean</li>
<li>4 cardamom pods</li>
</ul>


<p>First thing is to bloom the gelatin in cold water, using whatever timing the manufacturer recommends.  Pierce the
cardamom pods to help let the flavor out&mdash;either use your hands to crack them a bit, or score the pods with a knife.
For the sugar, just split the bean down the middle and scrape out the seeds.  Because of the moisture, the seeds often
come out feeling more like a paste; just knead it into the sugar with your fingers to prevent clumps in the final
product.</p>

<p>Add about 50ml of the cream to the sugar, and whisk&mdash;Again, this is just to prevent any clumping that may occur.  Add
the rest of the cream, and the cardamom pods, and bring everything to a light simmer&mdash;be careful that it doesn&rsquo;t come to
a full rolling boil.  Hopefully the gelatin has bloomed by now, so add that and let it simmer for another minute or two.
Pour the cream into whatever containers are appropriate, and let everything set in the fridge.  I recommend at least 3-4
hours, preferably overnight.</p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>

<ul>
<li>The apples came out way denser than I expected.  I&rsquo;ve never worked with pectin before, but I think the big mistake was
not accounting for the naturally occurring pectin in the fruit itself.  On hindsight, given how the most commonly sold
pectin is <em>apple pectin</em>, this was kind of a dunce cap moment.</li>
<li>The fruit was also way stronger and sweeter than I expected.  Next time I might dial down the sugar/vanilla in the
fruit, serve less of it, or just not combine it with something as delicate as panna cotta.  Haven&rsquo;t quite decided on
that one yet.</li>
<li>The panna cotta did not have gelatin problems (thankfully), but it was still a bit dense.  For the next try I might
cut the cream down with some milk, probably about 500ml cream to 100ml milk.</li>
<li>The cardamom also didn&rsquo;t come out as much as I would have liked.  It was just barely noticeable if tasting the cream
alone, so I think in the future a full 6 pods for 600ml liquid would be better.  Or even more if being served with
something as strong as a fruit compote.</li>
<li>Now that I think about it, maybe I&rsquo;d be better of cutting out the fruit and serving the panna cotta alone with some
sugar syrup that I&rsquo;ve steeped with cardamom pods.</li>
</ul>
