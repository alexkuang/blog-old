<p>Week 2&rsquo;s theme is Polish, a cuisine that I basically have never touched, or so I thought.  According to the
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1ujvk2/week_2_introduction_thread_polish/">introduction thread</a>,
Polish food involves a lot of meat and potatoes, and the list of example foods included golabki which I&rsquo;d made a bunch
of times already under its Russian name golubtsy.  But choosing that felt too much like cheating, so I went with pierogi
instead.</p>

<p>Since I had only heard of the term pierogi and had no idea what it actually was or what was involved, the first obvious
stop was Google.  A few quick searches revealed that it was the polish equivalent of a filled dumpling/ravioli, and the potato
filling + sour cream in the skin distinguished it from all the other types of dumplings I had seen.  Since the skin
was a bit more foreign and required some resting time, I decided to start with that first.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>Skin</h4>

<p>Normally I&rsquo;m the first guy to start screaming about scales and precise weights when anything involves dough, but for
things like dumplings I believe that approximations are perfectly fine, and a scale is probably excessive.
Nevertheless, since this was the first time I decided to jot down some numbers for consistency&rsquo;s sake:</p>

<ul>
<li>250g flour (~2 cups)</li>
<li>50g softened/melted butter (~&frac14; cup)</li>
<li>160g sour cream (~&frac12; cup)</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>


<p>I combined the flour with the egg and salt to make a crumbly mixture, then added the butter and sour cream.  The dough
incorporated very easily after a few minutes of working, and was very pliable.  I let it rest for about 30 minutes while
I prepared the filling.  Resting only made the dough even softer because of the relaxing gluten; I also suspect that the
sour cream has a loosening effect like a weaker version of ascorbic acid in puff pastry dough, but I&rsquo;m not 100% on that
so don&rsquo;t quote me.</p>

<h4>Filling</h4>

<p>The filling was exceedingly simple.  I just boiled up some yellow potatoes, and mashed them without liquid.  The
seasoning was salt, pepper, and shredded sharp cheddar; I&rsquo;d say the cheddar was somewhere around 1/3 to &frac12; of the
volume of mash that I had.  After everything was mixed, I stepped away for a cup of coffee (and to let the filling fall
to room temp so it wasn&rsquo;t burning hot, if you care about that sort of thing).</p>

<p>After the filling was prepared and cooled, I rolled out the dough into a ~1/8 inch sheet.  I aimed for something a
little bit thicker than ravioli skins, but not by much.  But since I didn&rsquo;t have a dough cutter and actually needed
circular skins, I decided to use a drinking glass instead:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pierogi/i-QX4VMGK/0/L/DSC_2337-L.jpg"></p>

<p>After pressing out all the rounds, there was a non-trivial amount of dough scrap left which I felt bad about.  I was
feeling daring so I just re-worked and re-rolled it to get as many rounds as possible; the only thing I&rsquo;d note here is
that an additional resting period is necessary for the gluten to re-relax, so I&rsquo;d recommend filling the pressed rounds
while waiting for that to happen.  Or, for the more lazy amongst us, I suppose the scraps could just be cut up and saved
to be dropped in soup or something&hellip;  But who wants to do that?</p>

<p>Wrapping is fairly easy.  Just fold the skin over a small mound of the potato mixture then press the edges together
with your fingers.  If the edges don&rsquo;t stick, you probably over-floured your board or something, so add a bit of water
to help it along.  To really seal things in and make them look prettier, press the edges again with the tines of a fork.
(For those who really care, the gallery at the bottom of the post has how much filling I used for each)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pierogi/i-c2DwTKD/0/L/DSC_2353-L.jpg"></p>

<p>A few of them are slightly lopsided, but not too bad for a first batch.</p>

<h4>Impressions</h4>

<p>Most sources online recommend boiling the pierogis and then frying them with butter and onions to serve.  Since these
are essentially potatoes in dough, I thought they&rsquo;d need a bit of help so I used roughly sliced shallots instead, and
added some kielbasa on the side.  Can&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;meat and potatoes&rdquo; style meal without the meat.</p>

<p>I think the biggest surprise was that pierogis are really &ldquo;go big or go home&rdquo;.  The quantities above are enough to make
roughly 20 skins, or a full two dozen if you really want to stretch it.  The filling needed for that amount of skin
could probably be made from one decent sized yellow potato, <em>maybe</em> two.  And since nobody wants to boil and mash one
potato, that means that you have to make about 100 at once for it to be worth the time.  Alternatively this could
probably be a nice use for leftovers of regular mashed potato, but probably not if you like your mash really creamy.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really speak to authenticity or anything since I&rsquo;ve never actually had pierogis, but I thought they were pretty
nice taste-wise.  Personally they reminded me of fried ravioli, except slightly thicker and more rustic.  I went in
expecting a super heavy mouthful of starch, but the texture was surprisingly light and the sour cream in the skin helped
things along.  I still don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d eat these alone, at least not the variety filled with just potato and

might change my mind.  Adding bacon is never a bad idea.</p>
