  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Caramelized-Lemongrass-Chicken/i-FBL6Qgb/0/L/DSC_3055-L.jpg"></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t make this as often as I should, since to be honest prepping lemongrass is kind of a pain even with a food
processor.  But when I do make the effort, it&rsquo;s totally worth it.  The refreshing flavors of lemongrass play really well
with the rich, strong flavors of caramel and chicken.  Plus, who doesn&rsquo;t like fish sauce?  Make sure to use the brand
with the crabs, though; otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<ul>
<li>1 lb boneless chicken thighs</li>
<li>4 stalks of lemongrass</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
<li>2 Tbs sugar, 2 Tbs high heat oil</li>
<li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
<li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
<li>cilantro</li>
<li>scallions</li>
<li>whole chilies</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
</ul>


<p>Start off with prepping the lemongrass.  Cut the bottoms off the stalks as well as the tops, right where they start
turning dark green.  Bash them a few times with the back of your knife (or a brick, I guess), and slice into thin rings.
Then run your knife through the thin rings a few times to end up with a fine mince.  This is probably the most painful
and labor-intensive part of this entire dish, but it&rsquo;s important.  Bruising and chopping the lemongrass in this way
is essential to releasing the flavor, but at the same time nobody wants to pick big pieces of lemongrass out of their
teeth.  For the lazy/economical among us, I&rsquo;m sure a few pulses in the food processor would also work.  I&rsquo;ve also been
told you can buy pulverized lemongrass frozen, but&hellip;  Come on.  If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, you obviously have the
time to do some proper prep.</p>

<p>Cut the chicken thighs into small &frac12; to 1-inch cubes.  If the thighs came with skin, great; keep it, it helps with
flavor.  If not, that&rsquo;s alright too I suppose.  Personally, I just buy thighs with bone and skin on, and just debone
myself.  And as with most of these types of dishes, I&rsquo;m morally obligated to note that trying to substitute chicken
breast here is a capital offense.  Thighs just have so much more flavor.</p>

<p>Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and a few tablespoons of the chopped lemongrass, and set it aside for a few
minutes.  In the meantime, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it&rsquo;s shimmery and just about to
smoke.  Add the sugar, which should melt with some stirring after a minute or two.  Keep stirring, and wait for the
sugar syrup to turn brown and caramel-y.  At no point should the mixture smoke: If it does, the pan&rsquo;s gotten too hot,
and should be taken off the heat for a bit.</p>

<p>Stir in the rest of the chopped lemongrass, the onion, and the garlic, and fry for a few minutes.  Crank the heat all
the way up and throw in the chicken.  After a minute, throw in the chilies, and keep cooking until the chicken&rsquo;s done.
Take the pan off the heat, then add the fish sauce.  (Hint: Make sure to save the fish sauce for when the high heat
cooking is done, or else it&rsquo;ll smell up the joint.)  Finish with chopped scallions and chopped cilantro.</p>

<p>With a solid bowl of white rice, this amount of chicken is probably good for serving about 3-4 people, depending on
appetite needs and size.  For this particular run, I ended up with a bowl of vermicelli, with julienned cucumbers and
mint on the side.  Topped with more fish sauce.  Having no exposure to any sort of Vietnamese home culture, I can&rsquo;t
really speak to this dish&rsquo;s authenticity or anything like that.  I mean, I&rsquo;m sure some Vietnamese food icon is rolling
in their grave over my use of fish sauce and vermicelli, but at least it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick post to show of a neat little trick for those who are more command-line-driven: bracket expansion.</p>

<p>Basically, bracket expansion means that <code>some-string-called-{x,y}-here</code> desugars in the shell to
<code>some-string-called-x-here some-string-called-y-here</code>.  This is especially useful if, say, you&rsquo;re in a Java-like
directory structure and you accidentally placed your source class in your test folder, and you need to move it back:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># desugars into mv src/test/java/com/foobar/app/Class.java src/main/java/com/foobar/app/Class.java</span>
</span><span class='line'>mv src/<span class="o">{</span><span class="nb">test</span>,main<span class="o">}</span>/java/com/foobar/app/Class.java
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or if you&rsquo;ve already committed to source control, this also works quite nicely with <code>git mv</code>.  Another nice example from
recent memory is, say, if you were cleaning up some directories nested by date and wanted to only wipe a few months:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rm /posts/2014/<span class="o">{</span>01,03,06,07<span class="o">}</span>/*.html
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Anyway, just a quick little post for a neat little trick.</p>

<p>This <em>was</em> going to be a big ol&#8217; fancy affair.  I set out to knock out two weeks&#8217; worth of challenges at once, and take
advantage of some sweet, sweet morels at the market.  Unfortunately, the potatoes decided to be uncooperative, so here
we are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, one of our tech leads at work previewed <a href="https://github.com/ogrodnek/analog-metrics-talk">a talk</a> that he&rsquo;s
planning to give on analog metrics for the upcoming Strange Loop conference.  I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play with
microcontrollers, and this really gave me a kick in the pants to get started.  Since I had a bit of amazon credit lying
around, I decided to buy an arduino starter kit with all sorts of buttons, lights, and doo-dads, but not enough power to
actually fry anything (I hope).  I still can&rsquo;t tell my head from my ass, but so far I can make a button turn on an LED.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was dragged somewhat skeptically to a honey store.  Yep, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;a honey store.  A store, that&rsquo;s
dedicated to honey.  I know.  Strange as it may sound, it&rsquo;s actually a thing.  But after my (thus far only) trip,
I&rsquo;m a convert.</p>

<p>I was really looking forward to the Molecular theme, since I&rsquo;d been itching to play with some of this newfangled
Modernist Cuisine stuff for a while now.  So I went ahead and ordered a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Pantry-Spherification-Kit/dp/B008657GS0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401210725&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=spherification+kit">spherification kit</a>
from amazon, and came up with the idea of pairing spheres with oysters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dark Souls 2 is a great game.  Let&rsquo;s get that out of the way.  I&rsquo;ve logged low 3 digits in hours of gameplay, and made
it through the game multiple times.  The combat system is tuned, there&rsquo;s a ton of content, and multiplayer is pretty fun
(or at least, it was at the levels I hung around).  But I still prefer the original, and Demon&rsquo;s Souls, over it.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s just after I dish out a healthy dose of self-deprecation about restaurant writing that I feel compelled
to write about another restaurant.  So I&rsquo;ll keep it short.</p>

<p>I went to Daniel Patterson&rsquo;s Coi recently.  The only thing I can say about the food is that it wasn&rsquo;t overtly
over-the-top.  Nor was it deliberately modernist or filled with crazy techniques using chemicals I can&rsquo;t pronounce.  But
it was very very delicious and still managed to surprise me.  I can&rsquo;t overstate how awesome this is, and would recommend
the trip to anyone given to spending unhealthy amounts of money on food.</p>

<p>Also bought a signed copy of the book while I was there.  I can&rsquo;t wait to read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were shooting the shit in the gym on Thursday, when the subject of wasted memberships came up.  As I&rsquo;m sure is common
in any other type of service with a monthly membership, we apparently have a fair amount of people who pay for an
unlimited pass but only show up once every two weeks or so.  Or even people who pay for a membership and just don&rsquo;t show
up at all.  This isn&rsquo;t such a big deal at a place where the monthly fee is $10, but for BJJ gyms in metropolitan areas,
the costs tend to fall somewhere between $100-$200 / month.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty significant amount of money.  So why would people spend it for a service they&rsquo;re not bothering to use?
Sure, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;one year&rdquo; contract for the gym, but owners tend to be understanding most of the time, and the effort in
canceling that is pretty trivial.  I think the real barrier is in the way people think about quitting.</p>

<p>When we pick up a hobby and things get serious, it starts working its way into our definitions of ourselves.  This is
especially true for something like jiu jitsu, which involves a heavy investment and intrinsically comes with rewards
like &ldquo;higher self confidence&rdquo;, but it also applies to anything from learning a new language to picking up an instrument
to experimenting with painting.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s only natural that when life starts getting in the way, we cling onto that image.  Maybe we go from every day to
only a few times a week.  Then once a week.  Then once a month.  Then <em>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m learning to speak Spanish, but
it&rsquo;s been a few months since I&rsquo;ve had the chance to practice&hellip;&rdquo;</em>  But we rarely ever cross the threshold into
consciously declaring that we&rsquo;ve quit.  Are you still really playing the guitar if it&rsquo;s been six months since you&rsquo;ve
touched it?  One year?  Three?</p>

<p>Canceling a membership requires the conscious decision that <em>yes, I&rsquo;ve quit</em>.  But we never really seem to cross that
point.  It&rsquo;s always one rationalization after another.  Perhaps if we&rsquo;re could be more honest with ourselves, we could
save a lot of the resources that that costs us, whether that be a monthly membership fee that could be better put
towards something else, or the energy and creativity spent in thinking up justifications for ourselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In some ways, the curehappiness backports came at the perfect time, since I&rsquo;d been looking for something to sharpen my
vim skills on.  Technically I work in vim day-to-day, but usually the rest of the mental activity involved with coding
end up pushing my vim-awareness more to the side than I&rsquo;d like.  This backport, however, was heavy on repetition but
otherwise braindead, so it made the perfect set of practice exercises.  And since I had such fun (hey, it was a really
boring Sunday afternoon&hellip;), I figured I&rsquo;d share in case anyone else finds this useful&mdash;or even better, has suggestions
to make similar tasks more efficient in the future.  Please note that this is a rather quick fly-by and assumes moderate
familiarity with vim mechanics.  I&rsquo;ll probably do more slow, detailed posts in the future&hellip;</p>
