  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been nearly two years since I&rsquo;ve done any serious baking and pastry work.  One part of it was graduating into a
full-time job that meant most of my time would be spent away in an office instead of at home keeping an eye on my dough
or batter or what have you.  The other part is my current apartment&rsquo;s oven being&hellip;  How do I put this politely&hellip;  a
piece of shit.</p>

<p>But the other day&rsquo;s challenge with the panna cotta ended up rousing the baker in me more than I&rsquo;d expected, and when
everyone around me started discussing macarons, I had a pretty bad case of my equivalent of the withdrawal shakes.  So I
figured I&rsquo;d take a shot at beating my oven into submission; after all, even with a proper oven I&rsquo;d MacGuyver&rsquo;d my way
out of worse things back in school.  The result?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-Bb46M8t/0/L/macred1-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Far from perfect, but it&rsquo;s good to know that my hands haven&rsquo;t completely rusted off.  And with the recent changes in
lifestyle, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to get back into more interesting experimentation as well; just have to be more
careful about not repeating the college experience and gaining a ton of weight along the way.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-tR5PPpB/0/L/macred2-L.jpg"></p>

<p>A shot of the shells as a bonus.  My piping still kind of sucks and I definitely need to practice and tweak more, but
overall it could have been much worse.</p>

<p>The few times I&rsquo;ve used vanilla have always been for dessert, so for this week&rsquo;s challenge I really wanted to try
something savory.  Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything that didn&rsquo;t sound horrifying even in my head, so I ended
up going with a dessert anyway; tough nuts.  To be fair though, I stuck with the spirit of leaving my comfort zone and
made multiple things I&rsquo;ve never done before&mdash;panna cotta and apple compote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In-app purchases and the free-to-play model have long been anathema to self-declared &ldquo;real gamers&rdquo; everywhere, but the
recent release (or re-release?) of classics like Tales of Phantasia and Dungeon Keeper seems to have brought yet
another wave of angry discussion to the forefront.  Understandably, people
<a href="http://www.baekdal.com/opinion/how-inapp-purchases-has-destroyed-the-industry/">are</a>
<a href="http://kotaku.com/a-cancer-thats-eroding-the-market-reactions-to-eas-1515121353">very</a>
<a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/10956-Dungeon-Keeper-Mobile-Review-Wallet-Reaper">angry</a>
<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2014/01/27/tales-of-phantasia-review/">that</a> their beloved classics are being turned into f2p
&ldquo;cash farms&rdquo;, but personally I think saying the model is &ldquo;destroying the industry&rdquo; is a bit hyperbolic.</p>

<p>In response, toucharcade recently published a post pointing out an article that takes a <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2014/02/03/iap-isnt-actually-destroying-the-games-industry/">stance to the
contrary</a>.  The original piece is
definitely worth a read to anyone who cares about the topic; it makes a number of good arguments regarding pricing
pressures and facing a realistic economy for the unprecedented levels of competition on iOS.  But it also notes that the
concept of paying for more content&mdash;the &ldquo;original IAP&rdquo;&mdash;dates back to the beginning of the industry with coin op arcade
machines.  This seems like a valid comparison superficially, but as someone who&rsquo;s shelled out way too many quarters on
the likes of Gauntlet Dark Legacy I feel like there are two fundamental differences that this argument glosses over.</p>

<p>First: arcade games always had a large skill component.  It might take a while to get good enough, but it was always
possible to beat the game consistently on sheer skill alone.  The game might have been hard, but the balance was never
so broken as to render completion impossible without the extra coins.  Second: in the cases of the most nefarious IAPs,
you&rsquo;re not paying to spend more time with the game; you&rsquo;re paying for the exact opposite.  When an IAP does nothing but
shorten a timer or increase a premium resource, you&rsquo;re essentially paying more money to decrease the time you spend with
the game.  All &ldquo;Skinner&rsquo;s Box From Hell&rdquo; arguments aside, that is probably what I object to the most.  I don&rsquo;t have an
indiscriminate hatred for the f2p model&mdash;there are definitely cases of it being executed well&mdash;but I have a fundamental
problem with paying more for less.</p>

<p>Being your token asian immigrant, my experience with cheese was limited to Kraft slices and string cheese.  Now, there&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with good american cheese on a burger, but I hated string cheese with a burning passion&mdash;Especially when
my mom wanted me to eat some as a snack, citing something or other about calcium and strong bones.  <em>Pfft</em>.  Subsequent
exposure to the likes of cheez-whiz and store-brand grated parmesan really didn&rsquo;t help, and eventually I just dismissed
cheese as categorically unpleasant.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve discovered the miracles of parmesan and mozzarella and even some more exotic ones like morbier and p&#8217;tit
basque.  But the first moment I realized that cheese could be excellent in its own right, and even be a major player in
a proper dish, was with raclette.</p>

<p>Raclette is commonly eaten in the swiss alps.  At its core, it&rsquo;s raclette cheese melted over boiled potatoes, commonly
served with cured meat and some pickles or vegetables in the root family; in the above photo, I went with the common
french pickle <em>cornichon</em> and some prosciutto.  The preparation is as easy as food gets: literally just boiling some
potatoes and melting some cheese (I recommend using a toaster oven or a broiler), and then arranging everything on a
plate.</p>

<p>But despite its simplicity, raclette had a large effect on expanding my worldview in food, so&hellip;  There it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Background</h4>

<p>Usually I don&rsquo;t care too much if an email or two gets dropped en route.  Between spam filters and sometimes-spotty
(cough, mobile) connections, it&rsquo;s not too much of a stretch to assume that things get lost once in a great while.  But
recently I was trying to set up an interview on the other side of the country, so naturally I paid a little more
attention than usual.  Everything was going quite well, correspondence was zipping back and forth, and I&rsquo;d even bought a
plane ticket for the trip.  But then a lull came when it was time to receive confirmation for hotel arrangements and a
rough schedule for the interview process.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, the HR rep had already tried to send the information twice at this point, but for some
reason the emails weren&rsquo;t landing in my inbox.  I sent one last-ditch follow-up when my flight was boarding, and got a
reply with the info (thankfully) right before the plane took off.  Along with the reply, the HR rep mentioned that the
previous emails she&rsquo;d sent had gone to <code>waffles@mochify.com</code>. <em>(aside: While <code>waffles@mochify.com</code> isn&rsquo;t the first email
I&rsquo;d give out professionally, I&rsquo;m thankful it wasn&rsquo;t something like <code>sexbadger69@gmail.com</code> &hellip;  Actually, now I wonder
if that address is open &hellip;)</em></p>

<h4>The technical details</h4>

<p>This was an old address that I&rsquo;d added to my various devices previously, but then removed for inactivity; I certainly
didn&rsquo;t recall sending any recent email from it.  But when I logged in to check the inbox, lo and behold the missing
emails were staring me in the face, along with a few others that had been &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; not too long ago.  Something smelled
fishy.  I checked over my Sent box for my regular email to no avail; all the correspondence was there, with the correct
<code>From</code>s and <code>To</code>s.  I ended up having to dig into the plain-text of the mime header to spot the issue:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>From: Alex Kuang &lt;[...]&gt;
</span><span class='line'>Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
</span><span class='line'>    boundary="Apple-Mail=_7DA4001C-0AA1-48BD-80F5-00ACDBCCAE9C"
</span><span class='line'>    Message-Id: &lt;ADFD0F4C-6FE0-41F5-AA68-EF8E9845B360@gmail.com&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    Mime-Version: 1.0 (Mac OS X Mail 6.6 \(1510\))
</span><span class='line'>    X-Smtp-Server: smtp.gmail.com:waffles@mochify.com
</span><span class='line'>[...]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>X-Smtp? What?</em>  After a bit of googling I discovered that Mail.app on the Mac keeps a list of outgoing smtp servers
associated with your mail accounts, which you can see in Preferences &ndash;> Accounts &ndash;> &ldquo;Outgoing Mail Server&rdquo; &ndash;> Edit SMTP
Server List.  The problem is, the entry with the association persists <strong>even after an account is removed from the
list</strong>: when I checked my smtp list, it included an entry for mochify as well as a few other one-off addresses that I&rsquo;d
added and removed in similar fashion.  Most of my email (including <code>mochify.com</code>) is handled by google apps, which means
that the smtp server the entries pointed to were all <code>smtp.gmail.com</code>, and the only difference was the
username/authentication associated.</p>

<p>So what ended up happening here was that I&rsquo;d sent the email from my regular account through Mail.app so it still carried
the correct <code>From</code>/etc.  However, for reasons unknown, the outgoing smtp entry for that account did not work at
that moment.  Since <code>mochify</code>&rsquo;s smtp entry pointed at the same <code>smtp.gmail.com</code> server, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that Mail.app
decided it was a perfectly good fallback, added the <code>X-Smtp-Server</code> MIME header, and sent the email causing this weird
reply-to behavior.</p>

<p>There is a checkbox in account preferences that will lock you into using one-and-only-one smtp server and prevent this
from happening, but honestly after this ordeal I will probably just be even more biased towards composing my email using
the web gmail ui.  I&rsquo;m just glad that everything worked out in the end, and anyway this is a good reminder that I should
be more diligent in setting up auto-forwarding even for email addresses I don&rsquo;t plan on using.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about the weekly food challenges is that it syncs very well with my new self-imposed weekly post
quota.  This works out nicely for me, but at the same time it provides a very convenient cop-out from having to write
anything new, e.g. about tech.  While at the end of the day I&rsquo;m still writing more than I would have, I&rsquo;m wondering if
it&rsquo;d be a good idea to stop counting these towards the weekly quota, or only count them partially.  Another option would
be to pick and choose which challenges to limit the volume, but cherry-picking challenges is for weenies.  Thoughts for
the future, I guess.</p>

<p>At any rate, the &ldquo;point&rdquo; of this week&rsquo;s theme is simplicity&mdash;Getting good flavor out of an easy set up, i.e. &ldquo;one pot&rdquo;.
It seemed like a good time to test out my burgeoning indian food skills, but as it turns out the most complicated part
was just the combination of the spices.</p>

<p>Week 2&rsquo;s theme is Polish, a cuisine that I basically have never touched, or so I thought.  According to the
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1ujvk2/week_2_introduction_thread_polish/">introduction thread</a>,
Polish food involves a lot of meat and potatoes, and the list of example foods included golabki which I&rsquo;d made a bunch
of times already under its Russian name golubtsy.  But choosing that felt too much like cheating, so I went with pierogi
instead.</p>

<p>Since I had only heard of the term pierogi and had no idea what it actually was or what was involved, the first obvious
stop was Google.  A few quick searches revealed that it was the polish equivalent of a filled dumpling/ravioli, and the potato
filling + sour cream in the skin distinguished it from all the other types of dumplings I had seen.  Since the skin
was a bit more foreign and required some resting time, I decided to start with that first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&mdash;Or, really ghetto okonomiyaki&hellip;</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Ramen-Cake/i-zJ4NmjL/0/L/DSC_2315-L.jpg"></p>

<p>It should come as no surprise to anyone that I&rsquo;m subscribed to
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking">/r/52weeksofcooking</a>.  The tl;dr is that each week, the subreddit chooses a
food &ldquo;theme&rdquo;&mdash;an ingredient, ethnicity, or some other idea&mdash;and users post dishes that they make according to the theme.
I&rsquo;ve always thought that the idea seemed like a lot of fun, so what better time to start than the new year?  If nothing
else, it makes good blog fodder.</p>

<p>Week 1&rsquo;s theme is eggs, which is a nice and easy start to this little series of experiments.  For this theme I chose
what I like to call &ldquo;ramen cake&rdquo;.  The idea is roughly the same as that of okonomiyaki&mdash;In fact, I got the idea after
watching the corresponding <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od2YWgQmeo4">video</a> on Cooking With Dog (an excellent channel
in general, by the way).  It&rsquo;s a nice way to have ramen that doesn&rsquo;t come in a bowl of soup, and with the right
combination of fillings it could even be something approaching nutritious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been sick as a dog for the last couple of days, so I guess this week I&rsquo;ll keep it light.  Since it&rsquo;s about 0
degrees F outside right now, what better time to mention ramen?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-7f9FtLM/0/L/photo-L.jpg"></p>

<p>The above was made with pork belly, spinach, and pickled mushrooms.  I&rsquo;ll probably write everything up in more detail
when I&rsquo;m feeling more prolific, but I&rsquo;d like to take this chance to mention that a great use for the leftover bones
(say, from a roast leg of lamb, or a chicken carcass) is ramen stock.  Just roast the bones in the oven and stick them
in a pot with a few aromatics and vegetables: onions, leeks, carrots, mushrooms, and so on.  Leave it to simmer for a
few hours, and boom.  Stock.  If it&rsquo;s not feasible to leave the stove on, a crock pot would probably work just as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After watching the <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">wat</a> talk and trolling my friends with the
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world">aneditor</a> talk for about the 200th time, I decided to
finally purchase one season of the Destroy All Software screencasts, despite the (IMHO) steep price tag and my financial
destitution.  (So far?  Totally worth it.  But a full review of the screencasts is neither here nor there.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of the unix power tools&mdash;<code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>xargs</code>, and so forth&mdash;but the DAS talks introduced
an idea that had never occurred to me for some insane reason: combine them with git to extract some interesting
information about your codebase.  And so, I decided to go diving into my biggest scala project for insights about its
code size.</p>

<p>One of the most common problems that code size can indicate is the presence of &ldquo;god classes&rdquo; or libraries, which know
and do way too much and thus are correspondingly bigger than the rest of the code by orders of magnitude.  This command
was relatively simple and does not involve git, so here it is in its entirety:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output was slightly interesting, but nothing groundbreaking.  300 lines is not ideal to me, but manageable.  Broken
down quickly, <code>find #...</code> finds all files inside the current directory ending in &lsquo;.scala&rsquo;, reads each file in, and
passes it off to wc -l, which does a linecount on the file, whitespace and all.  <code>sort</code> does what its name implies, with
<code>-n</code> making it sort <code>1 2 3 11</code> instead of <code>1 11 2 3</code>.  The information was slightly cool, but as a hack it&rsquo;s not very
interesting, so let&rsquo;s throw some git in there to try to get a sense of how fast the codebase has grown over time.  After
all, superlinear growth is usually indicative of a ton of repetition and therefore unnecessary code complexity.</p>
