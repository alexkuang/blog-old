  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, my gaming bandwidth has been taken up by the new Zelda game, A Link Between Worlds.  It&rsquo;s been a while since
my last trip to Hyrule, but I&rsquo;ve always loved the ingenuity behind the dungeons, especially the ones in Ocarina of Time
which could take upwards of hours (Water Temple, I&rsquo;m looking at you) to complete on the first run.  One of them jumps to
mind particularly: The Forest Temple, a dungeon you encounter in the early-mid game immediately after gaining access to
adult Link.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like a completely normal dungeon&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got your wolves, you&rsquo;ve got your carnivorous plants,
and the obvious puzzle in the form of 4 torches that have to be lit.  Fairly straightforward, until the game hits you
with this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/forest-temple-hallway.jpg"></p>

<p>The first time you hit the twisting hallway, you have to follow it as-is to the other side, your perspective being
warped, to end up in a room with you standing on its &ldquo;wall&rdquo;.  On the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; is a chest, inaccessible in your current
state, and further on is a door you don&rsquo;t have the key to.  After a few more rooms and a battle with some wolves, you
end up with the bow which allows you to hit a switch to un-twist the hallway, bringing a completely new
perspective to the rooms&mdash;Most obviously, the chest from the earlier &ldquo;floor&rdquo; is now reachable, and after a little
contemplation and a lot of climbing, you get the key to the previously locked door&hellip;  <em>Which you can&rsquo;t access until you
re-twist the hallway.</em></p>

<p>This simple sequence is, in essence, what makes the classical Zelda dungeons challenging and oh so much fun.  In
addition to an &ldquo;item of the moment&rdquo;, each area contains an inventive mechanic that completely changes the landscape
of the entire dungeon.  A room is completely different when your perspective is rotated, platforms become traversable
after you flood the floor with sand, and so on.  It&rsquo;s no longer just <em>Push a block over here</em>, it&rsquo;s <em>Push a block over
here to change the water level so we can push that other block, and then change the water level back to align the two
blocks properly and maybe we can finally get to that chest over there.  Oh wait, that didn&rsquo;t work, maybe if I switch the
water level back BEFORE moving the second block&hellip;</em></p>

<p>Sound familiar?  The hardest dungeons&#8217; mechanics tend to use some piece of outside state to introduce exponentially more
complex interactions between the existing items that Link already has access to.  Interactions that now depend not only
on the current environment, but also the configuration of surrounding environments, and probably the order that
everything was done as well.  Keeping track of all that is welcome, even enjoyable, when I&rsquo;m playing Zelda.  But I have
no wish to be dealing with such things when I&rsquo;m trying to make sure my code is doing what I want it to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://overwatering.org/blog/2013/12/scala-1-star-would-not-program-again/">blog post</a> has recently been making the
rounds in all the usual programming fora&mdash;/r/programming, hackernews, and so on&mdash;even eliciting a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-debate/153H3Ya4Nxk">response</a> from Scala&rsquo;s creator himself.  There&rsquo;s a
lot of discussion both productive and inflammatory out there already, but I thought I&rsquo;d jot down my perspective on the
common points as someone who: 1. picked scala up relatively recently (2.9.2 and 2.10), 2. has worked with it for a few
months on the side, and 3. comes from a background of dynamic languages.</p>

<h4>Long Compile Times</h4>

<p>I can definitely see where this is coming from.  Scala&rsquo;s compile times can be pretty long, though I had pegged that as
the cost of using a compiled language anyway.  I, at least, felt a marked increase in times upgrading from <code>2.9.2</code> to
<code>2.10</code>, presumably from the slew of new features like macros.  However, it seems that <code>2.11</code> will thankfully be
<a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/state-scala-2013">focused</a> on compiler optimizations.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve found that
judicious use of some of Scala&rsquo;s heavier features (such as implicits) keeps the compile times manageable.
<a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/">JRebel</a> has been a godsend as well for hot-reloading in incremental
compilation, and they do offer a personal Scala license for free.  Without JRebel my life as a scala user would have
been a lot harder.</p>

<h4>Opaque Syntax</h4>

<p>I agree completely here.  Scala&rsquo;s flexibility in parsing + its allowance of symbolic method names obviously allows for a
lot of flexibility.  This allows the construction of all sorts of DSLs; whether these DSLs end up being expressive or
just plain confusing, is another thing altogether.  In this case, I&rsquo;d have to say that just because something is
possible does not mean it should be done all the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past, my biggest problem with blogging has always been with finding something to write about.  Every time an idea
came, I&rsquo;d recall the original post that inspired it, or have one miraculously pop up on google upon doing more
research.  Inevitably the post would be articulate, well-researched, and laden with comments from impressed readers to
boot.  And I would hit control+w, convinced that I don&rsquo;t have anything to add; even if I did, I&rsquo;m an awful writer and
nobody reads my blog anyway.</p>

<p>But writing is an Important Skill, one that I&rsquo;d very much like to improve.  I&rsquo;m certainly not going to get any better by
<em>not</em> doing it, and <a href="http://weknowmemes.com/2012/05/sucking-at-something-is-the-first-step-to-becoming/">everyone has to start somewhere</a>: keep practicing, keep
drilling, keep jabbing away, and eventually you&rsquo;ll probably make progress.  I remember an old post of Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s
where his only advice was to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step.html">pick a schedule</a> and stick
with it.  Maybe it&rsquo;s about time I did just that.  <strong>One post a week</strong>, even if the topic sounds asinine and I&rsquo;m low on
inspiration and nobody will read it (or <em>especially</em> if nobody will read it?).</p>

<p>With all that said, I&rsquo;d like to introduce my newest housemate, <a href="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Animals/Zelda">Zelda</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Animals/Zelda/i-rNGBWHH/0/L/DSC_2268-L.jpg"></p>

<p>She arrived with all of 3 days&#8217; notice, and is at just about that age where kittens tend to be terrible people.  She&rsquo;ll
bully the other (much bigger) cats, knock over bowls and trash bags, attack everything like the king of the jungle, and
just generally be an unabashed little snot.  But she&rsquo;s disarmingly adorable, so naturally none of that matters in the
slightest.</p>

<p>Last weekend I saw a giant leg of New Zealand lamb that looked way too good to pass up, crazy Whole Foods prices or not.
Huge roasted joints of meat are always a win with me but I strongly prefer bone in; there&rsquo;s just so much more flavor
that way.  I took the basic steps from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvEdCmD8Pk">this video</a> by Thomas Keller, using
an oven temp of 325 for ~1hr and frenching the tip of the bone to aid in carving.  I finished the last few minutes with
a cranked up broiler to really get a nice crust on the surface.</p>

<p>There was one problem I had with the conventional wisdom, though: laying the herbs on/around the meat and just seasoning
the surface doesn&rsquo;t seem like it would be enough to really get that taste in there, especially with something this
thick.  So I took a cue from how cloves are used in ham, substituting the cloves for garlic and the ham joint for a lamb
leg.  Spearing the garlic with small sprigs of rosemary added just the right extra punch, and ended up staining the
garlic green as a bonus.</p>

<p>I would consider this experiment a success.  Embedding the garlic really gets the flavor into the meat, and the rosemary
adds a lot to the presentation as well. If nothing else, it can be an excuse to crack some Monty Python shrubbery jokes
at the dinner table.  Chances to do that don&rsquo;t come around nearly as often as they should.</p>

<p>Nothing fancy, just one of many possible variations of the fibonacci sequence.  This one is done via a <code>Stream</code>,
which is Scala&rsquo;s memoized lazily evaluated list.  (<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream">More here</a>).</p>

<p>Will probably write more about the why/how of the nested loop <code>def</code> (mostly for my own reference), but for now I think
the codeblock looks pretty neat.  It&rsquo;s still a shame I didn&rsquo;t get to play with funny line numbers/highlighting stuff
though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&hellip; Or, &ldquo;How I Chose a Blog Platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Multiple people have said that I should get back into writing, so I guess I&rsquo;m back into the blogging scene now.  It&rsquo;s
true I did have a food blog before a particular work project completely pole-axed it, and I would love to start it up
again.  The problem is that WordPress has always been a bit cumbersome for me so this time around I wanted something
different.  Plus I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get into the whole tech/misc blogging thing.  So I set out to find something that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is easy to write in.  I&rsquo;d been fascinated by the idea of blogging in Markdown, so preferably that.</li>
<li>Could render code snippets / do syntax highlighting in most major languages.</li>
<li>Could display pictures with reasonable flexibility and prettiness.</li>
<li>Supported some form of organization based on categories/tags.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://telegr.am/">telegr.am</a> was a strong contender for a while, since it uses Markdown and is written in <code>Scala</code> and
thus would have been familiar ground, but sadly it was missing in some key features.  All the other frameworks I found
were either lackluster, pay-only, or required self-deployment on a server, which I&rsquo;m clearly too lazy to do nowadays.
Thus I came to settle on <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, a framework based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which I
had already played with for my personal site before.  Thus far it fits the bill nearly perfectly, with the only rub
being the heavy dependency on git (or in my particular case, github).  But that isn&rsquo;t really a problem unless I ever
want a blog with non-technical contributors, so that bridge can be crossed when the time comes.</p>

<p>TL;DR &ndash; New blog.  Pardon the appearance during construction.</p>
