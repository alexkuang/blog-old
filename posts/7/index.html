<blockquote><p>Ah yes, 100th post&hellip;  Pretty sweet.  Since this post I have eaten (quite a few) liege waffles from the likes of
Zinnekin&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m happy to report that this recipe is reasonably close, albeit with a different shape since I did not
and still do not have the proper iron for liege waffles&hellip;  But, what can you do.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Waffles/i-LPqwbVL/0/L/DSC_1136-L.jpg"></p>

<p><em>Edit:  Before I say anything, I just realized&hellip;</em></p>

<p><strong>Happy 100th post to us.</strong></p>

<p>&hellip;  That is all.</p>

<p>\&lt;/edit></p>

<p>Way way back over half a decade ago, when I was still an uppity little teenybopper, I decided to adopt NuclearWaffle as
my handle for all my internet goings-on. I can&rsquo;t remember why, but it probably had to do with an unhealthy fixation on
blueberry Eggo waffles. Whatever the case, over the years that has translated to waffles being the general motif for all
my screen names and such, and just a general nickname from old friends.  Despite this, over the years I haven&rsquo;t actually
eaten that many waffles.  Eggos I stopped because I was too lazy to buy a toaster, and all others because I was too lazy
to buy a waffle iron.  However, now I have both.  And since I hope nobody needs my help in properly preparing Eggo
waffles, I turn to my other favorite, the Liège waffle.  I mean, what kind of blog would I be running if I couldn&rsquo;t
devote some time to my namesake?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Waffles/i-KcMZ4rZ/0/L/DSC_1070-L.jpg"></p>

<p>As a note, it <em>IS</em> Liège, with an accent.  For some reason WP refuses to put accented letters in the title.  Now that
that&rsquo;s out of the way&hellip;  This waffle is a variation out of Belgium, using yeasted dough and a special pearl sugar.
Once cooked, it is topped usually with more sugar, along with (depending on tastes) whipped cream, caramel sauce, or any
number of things.  As you may have deduced by now, this thing is diabetes city.  A fully loaded waffle with caramel
sauce, nutella, strawberries, and powdered sugar?  The perfect discreet way to end at that crabby old man across the
street who always kept the tennis balls that got lost in his yard.</p>

<p>The type of waffle iron doesn&rsquo;t really matter here; the differences will mostly be in crunchiness and thickness.  Just
about any iron will do, but I personally favor the ones explicitly labelled &ldquo;Belgian waffle&rdquo;, even if they are referring
to another type of Belgian waffle.  That being said, the pearl sugar is an important part of this waffle.  The heat from
the iron changes the composition of the sugar and melts it slightly as well, resulting in warm crunchy pockets of sweet
deliciousness.  Sure, you can go without it or substitute for regular sugar, but then you just have a sweet bread
waffle, and where&rsquo;s the fun in that?  And now for the nitty gritty&hellip;</p>

<h3>Ingredients (4 waffles)</h3>

<ul>
<li>200g flour</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>80g butter</li>
<li>100g milk</li>
<li>4g yeast</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp cinnamon (to taste)</li>
<li>4g vanilla extract (to taste)</li>
<li>65g pearl sugar</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Melt the butter and warm up the milk.  If your yeast requires that it be &ldquo;activated&rdquo;, dissolve it in warm milk&ndash;just
make sure it&rsquo;s not so hot that it dies.</li>
<li>Combine the flour, egg, yeast, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Add the warmed milk and melted butter, and mix until a doughy
consistency.</li>
<li>Let the dough rest until it doubles in size, approximately 30 minutes to an hour depending on temperature.</li>
<li>After the dough has risen, mix in the pearl sugar.</li>
<li>Heat up the waffle iron, and cook. Yes, the lumps of sugar will not melt into the dough; this is a good thing.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Waffles/i-3bv3qgF/0/M/DSC_1119-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Top with powdered sugar and whatever else you feel like.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s really not much that can go wrong here.  But for the optimal rise, a little trick I like to use is to put the
dough (covered!) with a pot of boiling water in a deactivated oven.  That way, you can maintain a predictable warm
temp optimal for rising, without it being so hot it kills the yeast.  I use this whenever it&rsquo;s winter and I need
something to rise in a punctual fashion.  Of course you can just give the dough more time, but that&rsquo;s pretty much
dependent on preference and degree of boredom.</li>
<li>Likewise for the timing on the cooking, I don&rsquo;t really have advice here.  Following the waffle maker is a pretty safe
bet, but even that not might be accurate since it may not be designed to handle dense sugary dough like this one.  The
best bet is waiting 4-5 minutes, and then just going by instinct&ndash;the color is a good indication of degree of
cooked-ness here.</li>
<li>Yes, the waffle iron is going to look like a mess with lumps and melted sugar and butter all over the place. But
luckily, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to clean. Once you let it cool down, the melted sugar and sugar should solidify and lift
right off the iron with a bit of vigorous wiping with a dry paper towel&ndash;if they don&rsquo;t, then you need a new nonstick
coating. A few minutes and the iron should be good as new.

<blockquote><p>One thing I&rsquo;d forgotten to mention here is that what I wrote is really almost a cross between Steak Diane and Steak Au
Poivre.  The Brits and French will probably roll in their respective graves at this, but in my head they&rsquo;re similar
enough to mix and match with impunity.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-tn3R33D/0/L/DSC_0904-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Back when I first started cooking I watched a lot of Kitchen Nightmares and Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen&ndash;yes, the awful American
versions, complete with all the yelling and the melodrama.  I worshiped at the altar of Gordon Ramsay and the Church of
his mentor Marco Pierre White, the latter of whom I referred to jokingly as Douchebag mainly for his finger-waving and
way of emphasizing his philosophy of &ldquo;inten-see-fying&rdquo; the flavor.  Between the two of them I managed to learn how to
cook my first steaks without butchering them (har har) and a million variations since, and this is one of my favorites
that I go back to time and time again.  The combination of sweet/spicy and rich cream that goes into the sauce produces
a flavor that I personally find amazing, and the cooking techniques make the dish turn out acceptably even if you screw
the pooch and make your steak well-done.  I&rsquo;m not saying you should&ndash;I&rsquo;ll still arch one eyebrow condescendingly and go
grab the shotgun&ndash;but at least the piece of leather on your plate will have some semblance of flavor, if you know what I
mean.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Boneless steak, preferably a good strip steak or ribeye.  Filet mignon if you&rsquo;re feeling especially rich, but I prefer
the rustic feel of ripping a NY strip apart with my teeth.</li>
<li>Worcestershire sauce&ndash;Lea &amp; Perrins is a must.  Go big or go home.  None of this organic apple cider vinegar nonsense.</li>
<li>Heavy Cream</li>
<li>Shallots&ndash;onions are also an acceptable substitute</li>
<li>Baby Portabello or White Mushrooms</li>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>(Optional) Cognac</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Take the steak out and let it rest for a few minutes.  Wrap it in some plastic or baking paper, and roll or press it
thin, as thin as you can.  While you&rsquo;re prepping, also thinly slice the mushrooms and shallots</li>
<li>Season the steak with the good ol&#8217; S&amp;P, and heat up your pan until it&rsquo;s extremely hot.  Use a small amount of oil,
and sear it very quickly on each side, one minute tops.</li>
<li>In the same pan (!!) add a bit more oil and saute the mushrooms and shallots.  Don&rsquo;t let things get too hot here,
burnt onions are only slightly less gross than burnt garlic in the overall scale of ruin.</li>
<li>Add the Worcestershire sauce, and delight in the sizzle that results.  Also note the effect it has in lifting the
great bits of flavor off the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Finish with the cream and some cracked pepper, and add the steak, letting it cook in there for a few minutes to get
the flavors in.</li>
<li>Optionally, if you have some cognac lying around (cause you know, who doesn&rsquo;t?), you can pour it on top and light it
on fire.  Just watch the eyebrows.</li>
</ol>


<p>And the obligatory&hellip;</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You notice how I don&rsquo;t comment on how much worcestershire sauce and cream to use.  The answer is&hellip;  I really don&rsquo;t
measure.  I add enough of the former so that it looks like it&rsquo;d be a decent amount of sauce, and then I pour in the
latter until I like how the color looks.  No, seriously.</li>
<li>When it comes to steak, or any other meat, resting is important.  When you cook anything big, you do a lot of waiting.
Why?  Resting before the cooking lets it rise to room temperature, and resting afterwards lets it finish cooking
evenly.  That&rsquo;s why if you ever get a steak at a restaurant that&rsquo;s too hot to eat, they&rsquo;re probably full of shit.</li>
<li>The (!!) note means that using the same pan is important.  Everybody knows the burnt crunchy bits at the bottom of the
pan are always the best parts; by not using them, you&rsquo;re just needlessly wasting flavor.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve only made this about twice since this post.  I love what the yogurt does to tenderize the meat and keep the
moisture in, but there&rsquo;s just something about tangy colloids in my fried chicken that skeeves me out a bit&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Persian-Fried-Chicken/i-B7Ngcrh/0/L/DSC_0936-L.jpg"></p>

<p>After the visit to BonChon I had an intense craving for fried chicken, but not of the dry KFC sort.  Unfortunately, the
closest thing I could get around here was King Chef, but that didn&rsquo;t exactly fit the bill either.  Luckily enough, at
that moment I thought of Oleana, and the Oleana book had a &ldquo;Persian Fried Chicken&rdquo; recipe, which involved marinating
chicken in yogurt before frying it.  Fried chicken, and a chance at playing with yogurt marination?  Score on two
counts.  Since this is from a book, out of respect I will keep quantities out (since in this case they are vaguely
important), and provide an amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spice-Flavors-Mediterranean-Ana-Sortun/dp/0060792280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315603047&amp;sr=8-1">link</a>
for purchase.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
<li>Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
<li>Plain yogurt</li>
<li>Saffron</li>
<li>Garlic, finely chopped</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Paprika</li>
<li>Dried Spearmint</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Oil, for deep-frying</li>
</ul>


<h4>Methodology</h4>

<ol>
<li>Puree the yogurt, saffron, and garlic in a blender with a little water until the mixture is uniform and a nice yellow
color.</li>
<li>Cover the chicken well with the marinade, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.  The rest is
important so the meat is tenderized by the yogurt, and the flavor from the saffron and garlic have time to seep in.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Persian-Fried-Chicken/i-8SJmJp9/0/M/DSC_0920-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Take the chicken out of the fridge, and brush off the excess marinade.  Dredge the chicken in a combination of flour,
paprika, salt, pepper, and spearmint.  For this part I didn&rsquo;t have any spearmint on hand, so I substituted it with
some coriander powder since it also has a sort of cooling effect.</li>
<li>Fill a medium skillet with a bit more than half an inch of oil, and heat it up to 350 degrees F.</li>
<li>Fry the chicken until golden brown and well-cooked, about 3 &frac12; to 4 minutes per side.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Persian-Fried-Chicken/i-7s222gr/0/M/DSC_0928-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Let the chicken rest a few minutes and dry out on a plate lined with paper towels.  Season with additional salt and
pepper, to taste.</li>
</ol>


<p>I ended up having the chicken with plain jasmine rice and some sauteed spinach, which made for a pretty good
combination.  In terms of the crust on the chicken, it&rsquo;s closer to the Asian varieties than the American, and the yogurt
had a pretty big impact on the texture of the meat.  Maybe this was because I didn&rsquo;t get enough of the marinade off
before frying, but I swear I tasted small bits of hot yogurt in there with the chicken.  On one hand, it did provide an
extra kick of moisture, but on the other it did impart a rather special taste.  Not necessarily bad, just not something
I&rsquo;d have every day.</p>

<blockquote><p>I really love the lighting on these pictures&hellip;  I remember that day being super nice and it just really clicked
without any reflective posterboard-type light wizardry.  New England needs more weather like that.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-x3Lj6zQ/0/L/DSC_1025-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Creampuffs are pretty easy and quick to make.  They are made of choux pastry, filled with pastry cream and topped with
whipped cream.  Common variations include profiteroles, small creampuffs filled with whipped cream/ice cream/whatever
and topped with chocolate; creampuffs with fruits; and the Paris-Brest, a ring-shaped choux filled with praline cream.
The process for the basic creampuff consists of boiling milk, butter, flour (et al), and adding beaten egg to form the
choux dough.  The dough is then piped into rounds, baked, and then cut open and filled with pastry cream and whipped
cream.  The pastry cream consists mostly of milk boiled with egg yolks and sugar.</p>

<h3>Ingredients - Choux</h3>

<ul>
<li>200g milk</li>
<li>80g butter</li>
<li>140g flour</li>
<li>5 eggs</li>
<li>18g sugar</li>
<li>1g salt</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology - Choux</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to 390F.</li>
<li>Put the milk, gutter, sugar, and salt into a saucepan.  Bring to a simmer to melt the butter.</li>
<li>While waiting for the milk to boil, you may sift the flour if you wish; it will make the next step easier.  This is
not mandatory though.</li>
<li>Pour all the flour into the saucepan at once and mix rapidly with a wooden spoon.  Work fast, the flour absorbs milk
very quickly and if you don&rsquo;t mix it fast enough, you will get lumps.  When finished, you should have a coherent ball
of dough, and a slight residue on the saucepan, like so:
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-X3krXDk/0/M/DSC_0941-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Beat the eggs until you have a homogeneous mixture.  Slowly (!!) add this mixture to the choux dough in the pot,
making sure that you incorporate the egg completely before adding more.  If you try this step too fast, you will get
lumps of dough floating in egg; you don&rsquo;t want this.  When done, the dough should be slick and shiny, and bordering
on a batter in consistency.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-hPLh9Wx/0/M/DSC_0945-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Pipe the batter into 1.5 inch mounds.  If you do not have a pastry bag, or are too lazy, drop the batter off a large
spoon; just don&rsquo;t expect anything too pretty if you do.  Use a large tip (I like Ateco #807), and do not move while
creating the mound.  This is for the most basic shape; until you get more experience don&rsquo;t attempt to use a smaller
tip to pipe a spiral or anything along those lines.  The slightest mistake will leave it leaning lopsidedly, like so:
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-PWGvP49/0/M/DSC_0968-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, then lower the temperature to 340F and bake for an additional 20 minutes.  The 390F
baking serves to expand the choux, and the 340 strengthens it.  Do not open the oven at any point during the baking;
the influx of cool air can very well collapse your pastries, and you end up with something looking like deflated
balloons.  Likewise, if you do not bake them for long enough for their size, they will not be strong enough and will
turn out limp and hard to cut, and will probably collapse as well.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Ingredients - Pastry Cream</h3>

<ul>
<li>500g milk</li>
<li>30g butter</li>
<li>100g sugar</li>
<li>100g egg yolks (about 7)</li>
<li>40g flour</li>
<li>vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology - Pastry Cream</h3>

<ol>
<li>Put the milk, butter, and half the sugar into a saucepan, and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Mix the yolks and the rest of the sugar together.  Add the flour and vanilla extract, and whisk further to combine.</li>
<li>When the milk is boiling, slowly pour about half of it into the yolk mixture while whisking rapidly to temper the
yolks.  Then pour this new mixture back into the remaining milk in the saucepan.  This process is to make sure you
don&rsquo;t cook the yolks too fast and end up with yolk lumps in sugary milk.</li>
<li>Put the pot back on the stove on medium heat, and keep whisking.  Do not stop whisking, or the bottom will cook
enough to solidify and create lumps in your cream.  The pastry cream is done when it starts bubbling and spitting
like a pot of polenta or porridge.  When you see the big bubbles, take the pot off the stove immediately; it&rsquo;s a fine
line between pastry cream and a sweetened scrambled egg.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-DHCx9h3/0/M/DSC_0954-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Leave the cream out on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper to cool.  You may cool it in the refrigerator if you
are in a hurry, but if you try that make sure you cover it with plastic wrap, so a skin doesn&rsquo;t form on top of the
cream.  This isn&rsquo;t mandatory for resting at room temperature, but it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>When you are done with baking the choux, you will probably end up with something like the following, allowing for
variance in size:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-fxPT3fX/0/L/DSC_0970-L.jpg"></p>

<p>This is the most basic shape.  You can try something more advanced with a smaller tip, or even a fancier top with a star
tip or something similar, when you gain more experience in piping these things.  Cut the creampuff open horizontally.
Where you cut it depends on your preference for the amount of pastry cream filling, amount of whipped cream, aesthetics,
etc.  The most common I&rsquo;ve seen seems to be a 1/3 top 2/3 bottom split, but I&rsquo;ve also seen it cut halfway across the
middle, or having just a tiny bit taken off the top for a dantier look.</p>

<p>Pipe the pastry cream into the choux, which should be empty (or very nearly) on the inside.  Top with whipped cream,
then the top part of the shell.  Dust with powdered sugar to taste.  Another option is to put some fruit on the whipped
cream before topping with the upper half of the shell; the possibilities are endless.  Personally I like using
hand-whipped cream stiffened with a bit of confection&rsquo;s sugar with a star tip to make it look a bit fancier, but if
you&rsquo;re in a huge hurry I guess reddi-whip will do as well&hellip;  Though the results won&rsquo;t be nearly as good.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-K2rdWXK/0/L/DSC_0994-L.jpg"></p>

<h3>Swan Variation</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen swan-shaped creampuffs in many bakeries, and it seems to be a fairly common improvement that doesn&rsquo;t take too
much effort to accomplish.  First, when piping you&rsquo;ll want to leave a bit of a tail on the base:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-Q3J9GwQ/0/L/DSC_0971-L.jpg"></p>

<p>When cutting it, cut it in half across and cut the top lengthwise in half to make two &ldquo;wings.&rdquo;  Fill the bottom with
pastry cream, then top with whipped cream.  I like a series of teardrop-like shapes using a star tip for a good effect:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Creampuffs/i-7b2JMH3/0/L/DSC_1022-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Simply attach the head (also choux pastry; simply pipe them with a small tip in a sort of S shape, and bake at 340 until
brown and stiff, usually about 15-20 minutes) and re-top with the wings to finish.  Again, dust with confectioner&rsquo;s
sugar for a nice effect.</p>

<h2>Amusing Stuff For No Reason</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<blockquote><p>Rollcake is still one of my favorite things to eat, to this day.  This particular experiment proved to be especially
useful: from where I live now it&rsquo;s kind of a pain to get to any Hong Kong-style bakery with regularity&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-GZsDtFD/0/L/DSC_0847-L.jpg"></p>

<p>This cake originally came from attempts to recreate what you can find at basically any chinese bakery/teahouse.  I threw
around with many western recipes, but most of them tasted horrendous, and were far too dry&ndash;much like western spongecake
recipes that I&rsquo;ve found in general.  In addition, there were some fairly convoluted rolling methods (there was one where
you would roll it without the filling, put it in the fridge, take it out, unroll it, fill it, and then re-roll it and
put it in the fridge) that ended up not working 99% of the time anyway.  Eventually, I went to Hong Kong google to look
for leads, which also didn&rsquo;t turn up  much, and started playing around on my own.  Of course, when I perfected the alpha
model, I trashed the hard drive I had the recipe written down on, and had to recently reconstruct it on the fly.  The
result below is the closest I&rsquo;ve come so far.  Plus it works very well as a general spongecake.  (Note:  There are
decimals in the gram measurements because I formulated this against 10 eggs; however, 5 eggs is plenty enough for most
occasions, and you can just round down for the measurements.  This will make enough to fill an approximately 12&#8221;x9&#8221;x1&#8221;
jelly roll pan.)</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>5 large eggs</li>
<li>75g flour</li>
<li>2.5g baking powder</li>
<li>50g sunflower or other neutral oil</li>
<li>40g milk</li>
<li>10g lemon juice</li>
<li>lemon zest</li>
<li>2.5g salt</li>
<li>37.5g sugar</li>
<li>100g confectioner&rsquo;s sugar</li>
<li>cream</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pre-heat the oven at 355 degrees F.</li>
<li>Separate the egg whites and egg yolks.</li>
<li>Combine the yolks with the flour, oil, baking powder, salt, sugar, and whisk to combine.</li>
<li>Add the milk slowly, 1/3 at a time, whisking until smooth each time.  This is to ensure you end up with a smooth,
lumpless batter.</li>
<li>Whisk in the lemon juice.</li>
<li>Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks, adding the confectioner&rsquo;s sugar a little at a time.  I prefer &frac12; of the sugar
when the whites foam, and &frac12; when the whites have formed stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Put 1/3 of the whites from step 5 into the mixture from steps 2-4, and fold in to combine.  Fold the resulting
mixture back into the whites.</li>
<li>Bake in a parchment paper-lined tray for 13 minutes, then lower the temperature to 200 F and bake for 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Take the tray out of the oven and remove the cake with the parchment paper from the tray.  Leave it out to cool to
room temperature.</li>
<li>While it&rsquo;s cooling, whip some cream&ndash;about 100ml is more than enough for this size of cake.  Don&rsquo;t use any
sugar&ndash;the sugar from the cake will combine with the cream after the appropriate rest.  Also, say no to whipped
cream out of a can.  Every time you fill a cake with coolwhip, God hangs a kitten.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of cream across the cake, leaving a few inches at the end so that when you roll it the cake will
stay rolled.  Roll up the cake with the parchment paper.  I actually don&rsquo;t have the words for this part, especially
since I haven&rsquo;t got a method down for consistently turning out good rolls.  So here&rsquo;s an animated picture to show
you how I do it.  The only tip I can give is to use the parchment paper as a support system so that the cake doesn&rsquo;t
break up while rolling.  There ARE a few other small things I&rsquo;ve noted, but I&rsquo;m not going to post them till I can
consistently reproduce results.  Soz.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-BGWXqq5/0/O/roll.gif"></li>
<li>Put the cake into the fridge.  Let the cake rest for a few hours so that the flavors from the cake and the filling
have time to meld, and the cream has time to set.</li>
<li>Slice and serve.  This is a good tip for cake in general, but run the knife under hot water and wipe it off with a
paper towel to heat up the knife; it results in a cleaner cut.  Repeat every couple slices or so.  This is useful
for other cakes, but especially for this one, and very especially if you are impatient and try to eat before the
cream has time to set.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do not put the lemon juice and the milk together under any circumstances.  Do not put them in the same cup to add to
the batter together.  Do not add lemon juice when you have a pool of milk on top of the batter.  Just don&rsquo;t.  Why?
Here&rsquo;s why:
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-mwNN62P/0/M/DSC_0801-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Do not skip the cooling period.  If you don&rsquo;t let the cake cool before filling it, it will melt the cream, making it
slide around, and it&rsquo;ll make the job of cake-rolling even harder.</li>
<li>When combining the white mixture with the yolk mixture, be thorough.  The combination is kind of like a macaron
batter, but much less anal; you have a lot of leeway, but you still need to be fairly precise with it.  Here is a
series of informative photographs to illustrate. Since it&rsquo;s harder to see in a regular batter, for these pictures I
used a batter laced with cocoa powder.</li>
<li>Picture 1: If you bake at this stage, you&rsquo;re an idiot. Notice the extreme bumps. The batter still holds its shape
really well. And more importantly, there are still streaks of discrete whites in the batter.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-hSWBkcj/0/M/DSC_0796-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Picture 2: Close, but not quite. Notice that the batter still sort of refuses to flatten down, and there are subtle
small white streaks in the batter.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-D6krDGn/0/M/DSC_0797-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Picture 3: Just ready. The color is completely even, and the batter flows, but it is still very very airy. If you keep
going after this stage, you will overmix and knock air out of the cake.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-s7KqGFL/0/M/DSC_0798-M.jpg"></li>
<li>For variations, you may substitute the lemon juice for more milk; just keep the amount of liquid consistent at 50g per
batch of this size.  Likewise, you can probably ditch the zest if you need, it doesn&rsquo;t play too well with, say, mocha
flavors.  For example, for the cake I used in the pictures, I subbed out the 10g lemon juice for milk, and added 4g
cocoa powder instead of lemon zest.  On that note, try not to add too much weight to the batter (for example,
substituting all the sugar for cocoa), as it will cause the whites to collapse.  Also some ingredients may be more
absorbent than others, which may result in a dry cake.  Whatever the case, tread lightly; if possible, just color the
cake and play with the fillings.</li>
<li>For fillings, it&rsquo;s best to use things that are not sweet, as the sugar from the cake with fuse with the filling while
it rests in the fridge.  When I make chocolate or coffee filling, I never add sugar; likewise for the plain filling.
One of the reasons that western rollcakes are so godawful is because their sponges are far to sweet, and they fill it
with jam, which results in a giant mouthful of sugar of diabetic proportions.</li>
<li>The ones I find at asian bakeries tend to have a brownish skin around the outside.  I still have not yet figured out
how they do this; even when I achieve it, it peels off on contact, and is not sturdy at all.  It probably has
something to do with a nonstick baking spray they use or something.</li>
<li>A common one is also a sort of semi lemon curd filling, except more delicious.  I WILL figure it out one day, but I
have not yet.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Origami 101</h3>

<p>I was feeling bored, so here is a simple instructional as to how to most effectively line your jelly roll pan with
parchment paper.  This is actually more important than you may think, as it will influence the shape of the cake, and
therefore make your life easier or harder depending on how you do it.</p>

<p>First, fold in your parchment paper so that it confirms to the dimensions of your pan.  I will use a smaller piece just
for demonstrations.  Let&rsquo;s start with the first corner:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-ZJTzjnh/0/M/DSC_0802-M.jpg"></p>

<p>Bring the flaps up, then bring together the creases (see next step).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-L4kgJcz/0/M/DSC_0803-M.jpg"></p>

<p>It should look something like this:  Fold down the paper, and you
have one corner done.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Rollcake/i-vpqPFrj/0/M/DSC_0804-M.jpg"></p>

<p>Repeat with the other four corners, and you now have a mini paper tray to put into the baking tray.   As a note, which
way the little flaps face does not matter, unless you&rsquo;re completely anally retentive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>This is a backport from my old blog.  Please see <a href="http://alexkuang.com/blog/2014/04/26/ch-backports/">this post</a> for more details.</h5>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-Belly-Buns/i-q4rsKHQ/0/L/DSC_0519-L.jpg"></p>

<p>For anyone new, pork belly is hands-down one of my favorite things to eat ever.  And as with any fatty meat, roasting it
makes it so much better.  Roasted slices of pork belly (pictured above) are a very versatile thing to have in the
kitchen.  You can pair it with breads, rice and kimchi (go, Koreans!), noodle soups, or basically anything you feel
like.</p>

<p>Hell, it&rsquo;s so simple to make I&rsquo;m not even going to post a formal ingredients &amp; methodology split at all.  All you need
is skinned full-fat pork belly, preferably in slabs; big strips if you can&rsquo;t get whole slabs.  Small pre-sliced ones are
not acceptable.  Mix a salt and sugar mixture, about one part salt to one part sugar if using kosher salt.  For regular
table salt (e.g. Morton) you&rsquo;ll have to reduce the salt amount to something like 1 part salt for three to four parts
sugar.  Rub the pork with enough of the mixture that it covers the entire surface and you can still feel the grains on
there; discard any excess.  Cover it in a tray that&rsquo;s JUST big enough to hold the bellies, the smaller the better, and
leave it in the fridge for 6 to 24 hours.  Any less and there won&rsquo;t be enough flavor; any more and it&rsquo;ll be far too
salty.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-Belly-Buns/i-4SQ2J93/0/L/DSC_0509-L.jpg"></p>

<p>When you take it out, the salt and sugar should have helped draw out some of the liquid from the pork, which will help
intensify the flavor.  Discard the liquid, and pop the bellies into the oven at 450 degrees, for about 45 minutes to an
hour.  You can also leave the bellies in there while the oven is pre-heating; this will help the fat render out.  During
this stage, it&rsquo;s okay if the bellies burn a LITTLE around the edges; this helps the flavor.  Baste the pork with the
rendered out fat about halfway in the cooking.</p>

<p>After the high heat cooking, reduce the heat to 250.  By now, the pork should be swimming in its own fat; this is why
you should put the bellies in as small a tray as possible.  This ensures that the fat covers as much of the surface of
the bellies as possible.  Cook it at this low temperature for another hour.  The technical term for this is confit,
though you may not have enough fat to cover the bellies properly in this case; it&rsquo;s alright, just baste them regularly.</p>

<p>After it&rsquo;s done cooking, let it cool to room temperature and then put it in the fridge to help it set and make it easier
to slice.  Sliced up, they&rsquo;ll keep a week or two in the fridge; more if you really want, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.
Reheat it in whatever manner is appropriate (I usually choose the frying pan, or just whatever stock I&rsquo;m boiling my
ramen in) before serving.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-Belly-Buns/i-NbPWpvh/0/L/DSC_0517-L.jpg"></p>

<p>The part with the oven?  Smells awesome.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-6SCMhpM/0/L/DSC_0370-L.jpg"></p>

<p>This chowder is the product of &ldquo;culinary exploration&rdquo;&ndash;that is, I wanted to exercise my newly obtained booze buying
abilities in the name of good food.  I started googling around for what was usual in clam chowder, but found results
unsatisfactory.  Clam chowder with a tomato base?  Burn in hell!  I ended up deciding to take matters into my own hands
and just make things up, using nothing but my wits and the memory of chowder at Legal Seafoods.  Two trials and a bit of
hilarity later, the result is probably one of the best dishes I&rsquo;ve pulled out of thin air to date.</p>

<p>During my first trial, I used a muscat wine, which was the first thing I saw lying around the apartment.  This was a
mistake, though not a terrible one; the muscat simply had a sweet taste in its own that interfered with the flavor of
the clams.  A dry white wine, such as chardonnay or a nice sauvignon blanc, is a much better complement.</p>

<p>A blunder-turned-success occurred when I bought the clams at Shaw&rsquo;s; apparently it is customary to use bigger &ldquo;quahog&rdquo;
clams as opposed to small &ldquo;littleneck&rdquo; clams for chowder.  Based on the first trial though, I concluded that littlenecks
are preferable, at least to my tastes.  It&rsquo;s true that they don&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;punched-in-the-teeth&rdquo; strength that
quahogs do, but the flavor is more subtle and they tend to be a little sweeter.  Plus, the plucky little buggers are
cute.  So I&rsquo;m just going to pretend I knew that all along, and that I planned the choice of littlenecks over quahogs all
along.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-hPS2bbm/0/L/DSC_0359-L.jpg"></p>

<p>How can you say no to that face?</p>

<p>And lastly&hellip;  Bacon is NOT optional here.  It&rsquo;s not.  There is no &ldquo;except&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s required.  Putting
aside the fact that not loving bacon is a cardinal sin in my book, the smokiness and pork flavor goes so well with the
clams that leaving it out is a travesty.  In fact, every time someone tries this without bacon, God beats a baby to
death with a microwave containing the remains of another baby.  You have been warned.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>15-20 littleneck clams</li>
<li>3-4 small yellow potatoes, Yukon Gold preferred, peeled and diced into &frac12; inch cubes</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
<li>3-4 thin slices bacon</li>
<li>dry white wine</li>
<li>thyme</li>
<li>milk</li>
<li>cream</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>garlic</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Boil the potatoes in a pot of salted water until cooked through and just tender.  This should only take a few
minutes.  Drain the potatoes and set aside when done.</li>
<li>While waiting on the water to boil and the potatoes to cook, remove sand from the shells of the clams.  A toothbrush
works admirably for this; a clean scouring pad will also suffice.  Brush it along the grain of the shell to get more
of the sand out and make life easier.</li>
<li>Put the clams in a large bowl with cold water to cover, and salt the water.  The salt-to-water ratio should be about
10% by volume.  Let the clams sit for about 5 minutes to allow more dirt and sand to settle to the bottom of the
bowl.</li>
<li>Drain the clams, then repeat the soaking for another 5 minutes, draining and rinsing them with more cold water when
done.</li>
<li>Heat about 2 tablespoons of butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 clove of garlic, crushed with the
flat of your blade, along with some thyme.  Dried and fresh are both acceptable, though fresh is probably easier to
work with (and remove).</li>
<li>Add the white wine, enough to come a few inches up the side of the pan and partially submerge your clams.  Let it sit
for about 2 minutes so some of the alcohol can cook off.  Add the clams, then cover the pan and let them cook.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-7Vtrx9D/0/M/DSC_0361-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Remove the clams as they open up, about 4 minutes.  Some of them might take a few minutes longer, so just let them
steam a bit more.  If they still haven&rsquo;t popped open and you&rsquo;re approaching the 8-10 minute mark though, chances are
they didn&rsquo;t make it and you should give up while you can.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Clam-Chowder/i-S756Fq9/0/M/DSC_0364-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Shell the clams, and set aside the liquid from the pan after filtering it to remove more sand.  For this, a fine mesh
chinois/china cap will do the job nicely.  If you&rsquo;re cheap like me, you can use a hand-held strainer lined with a
cheesecloth.  :)</li>
<li>Chop up the bacon into small pieces and fry them in a saucepan over medium-low heat.  You want the fat to start
rendering out and the bacon to cook, but not to the point where it&rsquo;s crispy.</li>
<li>Add the chopped onions to the saucepan.  If there isn&rsquo;t enough fat from the bacon, you can add a bit of oil&ndash;just
make sure it&rsquo;s an oil with little to no flavor.  Butter also works remarkably well here.  In addition to onions, you
may elect to use shallots.  I prefer to keep things simple though; this is peasant food, not fine dining.  Leeks are
also an option, but I draw a moral hardline at &ldquo;celery&rdquo; and &ldquo;carrots.&rdquo;</li>
<li>At this point, a lot of people would add flour to thicken.  While I don&rsquo;t have any issues with flour as a thickener
on principle, I disagree with its usage in this case for two reasons.  Firstly; you can always just let the chowder
reduce and thicken naturally.  This does make it contain more calories per volume, but let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves here.
It&rsquo;s a chowder, made of milk and cream and clams.  If you take down the whole pot in a meal, you&rsquo;re going to regret
it regardless of what you do.  There is also the option of cooking the potatoes more thoroughly, and using the
natural starch it releases as it melts slightly into the chowder as the thickener; this does make for really soft
melty potatoes, but I&rsquo;d really like to meet the person who eats chowder for al dente potatoes.  So I can assault him
vigorously with a rubber chicken.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to low, and allow the onions to cook slowly until translucent and slightly soft.  Add the potatoes
from earlier.</li>
<li>Add the milk and cream, enough to cover the potato/onion/bacon mix with a little bit to spare.  There should be an
equal amount of milk and cream (by volume).  Bring the mixture to a slow simmer.  Be careful not to have the heat
too high after this point; cream and milk burn pretty easily, especially if your pot is not non-stick.</li>
<li>Stir in the clam stock from before, as well as the clams.  You can either put the clams in whole, or chopped.  Or if
you&rsquo;re feeling really fancy, you can chop up 70% of them and save the rest to put on top of the chowder (I believe
the technical term here is garnish) when serving, to show that your food has Presentation and Class, and that you&rsquo;re
Moving Up In The World.</li>
<li>Let the mixture cook at a simmer, and let the chowder do its thing and thicken to an appropriately (that is,
subjectively) chowdery consistency.  At this point, you can do whatever garnishy things you feel like, including
fishing out all the pieces of bacon and frying them until crispy.  Otherwise, season with some salt and pepper, grab
a bowl, and go to town.</li>

<p>Even though pork comes first in the post title, the focus here is really the cloud ears.  The presence of this &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;
fungus makes this post another one following the general theme of &ldquo;Suck it, General Tso&rdquo; in my collection of chinese
food writing.  But seriously, it tastes good.  Cloud ears (also known as wood ears) is very unique in its texture,
slightly slippery and crunchy at the same time.  Definitely something to try at least one, fungophobia or not.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-with-Cloud-Ears/i-hJ88hH5/0/L/DSC_0238-L.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud ears</li>
<li>Pork, preferably a fat part like belly</li>
<li>scallions</li>
<li>Chiles</li>
<li>Red Bell Pepper</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Ginger</li>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Rice wine</li>
<li>Corn starch or flour</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>


<p>Methodology</p>

<ol>
<li>Soak the cloud ears in hot water for about 15 minutes, until they are soft.</li>
<li>While they are soaking, slice the pork and place into a small bowl with some shaoxing wine, salt, and water,
thickening with a little bit of starch or flour.  Use about 2 parts water to 1 part shaoxing wine.  Mix well, and let
it sit.</li>
<li>Chop up the scallions (you can see in the above photo I&rsquo;ve cut it at an angle so it&rsquo;s more pleasing), and cut the
bell peppers and garlic into thin slices.  Cut the ginger into small thin strips.</li>
<li>When the cloud ears are ready, cut them into pieces of similar size to the pork slices.  Make sure to remove any
knobby hard bits from the pieces.</li>
<li>Heat your wok over high heat, then add some oil.  When it starts to just smoke, add the pork, and stir-fry it
quickly.  When the pieces are just starting to cook and turn white on the outside, add the ginger, garlic, chiles,
and red bell pepper.  Stir-fry until you can smell the ingredients strongly, about 20 - 30 seconds.
<img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Pork-with-Cloud-Ears/i-SdsD6Pz/0/M/DSC_0239-M.jpg"></li>
<li>Finally, add the scallions and cloud-ears, and season with more salt, and some ground pepper.  Add some stock (or
water), and thicken it with starch or flour to form a sauce.  Wait a bit more until the sauce has thickened, then
serve.</li>

<blockquote><p>And the yellow lighting strikes again!  This was my first attempt at composing a photo&ndash;Notice the fancy bowl and
towel in the background?  I&rsquo;ve stuck with a more plain-jane/straightforward approach since then, but who knows&hellip;  The
artsy side of me might make a comeback.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-v6hjqR6/0/L/DSC_0124-L.jpg"></p>

<p>I think tea eggs are just one of those foods that are iconic to the Chinese, but never really took off in the West as
opposed to foods that are &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; but never really found in China&hellip;  You know who you are.  There really is no
equivalent for this snack as far as I&rsquo;ve found, but it&rsquo;s one of the easiest to make and the most convenient for anyone
who needs something to chomp on the go.  Not to mention the soy sauce in combination with the tea and the anise shoot
the flavor (I believe it&rsquo;s commonly referred to as &ldquo;umami&rdquo; nowadays) of the egg up to absolutely unholy levels that
border on the addictive.</p>

<p>The name comes from the lovely marbling pattern that results from cracking the shells of the eggs to allow them to
absorb flavors while steeping, and the spice-infused &ldquo;tea&rdquo; that the eggs steep in.  The basic version that I was taught
as a child was tea, star anise, soy sauce, and sichuan peppercorns, also known most commonly as huajiao in Mandarin; but
honestly, this formula can be distilled to just tea, star anise, and soy sauce.  Other common ingredients I&rsquo;ve heard of
are cassia bark (an asian variety of cinnamon) and fennel seed.  I&rsquo;ve also seen people use Chinese fivespice powder in
replacement for all of the above; it&rsquo;s not something I like to do personally, but it doesn&rsquo;t turn out terribly.  The
best tea to use is some variety of black tea, usually pu erh or something similar.  I like using Lipton Orange Pekoe,
it&rsquo;s cheap and actually goes fairly well in this case; in fact, I keep a giant box around for just this purpose.  &hellip;
Well, this and bubble tea, but that&rsquo;s another day.</p>

<p>Regardless, the preparation for this is exceedingly simple, and requires barely more effort than hard-boiling some eggs.
In fact, the only part that can be construed as even remotely challenging is the cracking of the shells after boiling,
but even that can be done by schoolchildren.  Technically, that part can be skipped and the eggs can infuse as-is in the
tea liquid, but to anyone considering skipping it I&rsquo;d like to say&hellip;  Really?  Come on now.  Get your head out of your
ass.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 dozen eggs</li>
<li>&frac34; cup soy sauce</li>
<li>6 star anise</li>
<li>4 tea bags</li>
<li>Optional: cassia, sichuan peppercorns, fennel seed</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Cover eggs with water in a large pot and bring it to a boil. Remove the pot, put a lid on it, and let it rest for 20
minutes, then rinse the eggs and cover with cold water to cool.</li>
<li>Crack each egg gently by rapping on it with the back of a spoon.  Try to keep the shells in one piece, but have the
cracks still be visible; they should resemble something like a spiderweb.</li>
<li>Put the eggs along with the soy sauce, star anise, and the teabags (along with any of the optional flavorings) into a
pot.  Add water until the eggs are just covered.  Put a lid on the pot and simmer the eggs for about 1.5 - 2 hours.</li>
<li>Let the pot sit on the stove for about an hour, then put it in the fridge to steep overnight, preferably longer; I&rsquo;d
say somewhere around a day is ideal, but they&rsquo;re technically edible after about 8 hours.  You can skip the first
step, but be aware that putting an extremely warm pot in the fridge WILL cause a change on the overall temperature in
there, so if there is anything sensitive in there, don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>They can be kept in the fridge for up to a week in the tea liquid, two weeks if you&rsquo;re feeling daring.  Drained and
peeled, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;ll last a bit more than half a week.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>I swear I had a better picture showing a cross-section with the different layers of chocolate and plain batter, but I
guess not&hellip;  Another one for me to remember to update later, I guess.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://waffleparadox.smugmug.com/Food/Oneshots/i-D2HdTsx/0/L/P1010107-L.jpg"></p>

<p>Chocolate marble cake was one of my first attempts at baking.  Or at least, one of the earliest successful (and
therefore not shameful and repressed) ones.  I don&rsquo;t make it too often now, as my tastes have migrated away from the
cake area for the moment, but it&rsquo;s simple, doesn&rsquo;t require much effort, and also has more butter than most people will
probably want.  While I have nothing against butter (I&rsquo;ll leave the rant against the modern day fat-crusade another
day), suffice to say&hellip;  If I brought this to a party, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody what I put in it.  Ever.</p>

<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s not nearly as heavy as the amount of butter would imply, though it&rsquo;s certainly not the lightest
dessert ever either.  It tastes just like it sounds like: a moderately rich cake, only slightly moist, with a strong
taste of chocolate that goes down exceptionally well with a cup of hot tea.  Personally, I like having a slice or two (a
la the photo above) with some whipped cream for breakfast on Sundays with a good mug of Jasmine Oolong.  But that&rsquo;s just
me.  One thing to keep in mind though is that this IS a butter cake.  That means it dries out very quickly, and it would
be best to keep it wrapped with a paper towel or somesuch (though not saran wrap, or it&rsquo;ll get soggy!), and microwave it
for about 10 seconds right before eating to revitalize it.  Do it, since warm and moist beats cold and dry any day with
this cake.</p>

<p>(Makes enough to roughly fill one standard medium loaf pan, about 4&#8221;x8&#8221;, I don&rsquo;t remember the exact dimensions.)</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>250g butter</li>
<li>430g sugar</li>
<li>5-6 large eggs</li>
<li>430g flour</li>
<li>10g baking powder</li>
<li>110g milk</li>
<li>30g cocoa powder</li>
</ul>


<h3>Methodology</h3>

<ol>
<li>Soften (or melt; in this case it doesn&rsquo;t matter) the butter, then mix with the sugar and the eggs.</li>
<li>Add the flour and then the milk, a bit at a time.</li>
<li>Put 1/3 of the batter into a separate container, and mix it with the cocoa powder.</li>
<li>Put the chocolate and the plain batters into their own pastry bags (or just cut holes into ziplocs if you&rsquo;re
lazy/strapped for materials).</li>
<li>Butter your loaf pan very thoroughly to protect against sticking.  This applies to non-stick pans as well; it just
makes life easier.</li>
<li>Pipe the batters, alternating plain and chocolate layers.  You may use whatever patterns you like, but the cocoa
powder in the chocolate batter should make it slightly heavier, and disturb the flat layers a bit while baking
regardless of what you do.</li>
<li>This is purely my opinion, but it&rsquo;s preferable to finish with a layer of plain batter on top.</li>
<li>Bake at 320 degrees Fahrenheit, for about 1hr 15min.</li>
</ol>
