[Roam Research](http://roamresearch.com/) is the darling of the latest wave of knowledge management / note-taking apps.
I've been using it for about two months now.  tl;dr - Roam delivers on its promise of networked thought and the features
around bidirectional linking are extremely well-executed.  However it does still have non-trivial downsides, for example
the mobile experience.  So I'm not a card-carrying member of the #roamcult just yet but I will continue to use it, at
least over the short-to-mid term.

## üòÑ

- The affordances for bidirectional linking are super slick.  A link can be created at any time by enclosing it in
  double brackets, e.g. `[[chicken]]`.  This ease makes it ridiculously easy to link pages of notes together, which
  delivers on the promise of "networked thought."
- The features around links are worth emphasizing.  The backlinks are automatically generated, which saves a bunch of
  work + friction, and the backlink display strikes a good balance for showing context around the link.
- Once the page is fully loaded up, everything is pretty snappy.  I tend to get annoyed at the "let's ease all the
  transitions and stick animations everywhere" brand of user-friendliness, and there definitely is not any of that here.
- Power user features abound.  [Block queries](https://roamhacks.com/how-to-query-roam/) and [embedding
  javascript](https://roamjs.com/docs/) stand out here -- although the latter definitely makes me nervous for all sorts
  of reasons.

## üòï

- UX is still pretty rough in some spots.  The initial loading screen is mildly annoying, and I personally find the
  sidebar functionality clunky and unintuitive.  However, the primary experience around links + note management is good
  enough that I'm willing to put up with the rest.
- Quotes are conspicuously missing from the markdown support.  I have no idea why.
- I find that my Instapaper queue is getting longer because I'll start reading on my phone and think, "oh right I should
  note this in Roam."  Keeping articles around until I can revisit on the computer is *just* enough friction for things
  to start getting backed up.  I haven't decided whether this is a good thing (forcing delination between "productive,
  deserves notes" reading vs entertainment) or a bad thing (friction is a habit killer, reading less is no good).


## üôÅ

- The roughest UX spots are still around mobile.  I wouldn't say the experience is outright terrible, but the things
  that I can work around in the browser definitely become a *lot* more annoying on the phone.  Reading is OK-to-meh,
  writing is moderately annoying, and capture is only just barely there.
- \*tinfoil hat on\*  Roam is "in the cloud," which means all data lives on their servers.  Normally I'm not a huge
  stickler for this, but any app functioning as a second brain is bound to contain sensitive information such as
  personal information, contacts' personal information, "opinions I would definitely not put on twitter," etc.  It would
  be great to see a self-hosted option, or more work around end-to-end encryption.
